<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention describes methods and apparatus for making acoustic musical instruments, including, but not limited to, ukulele, guitar, violins, and banjos, from gourds. More particularly, this invention teaches methods and molds for molding gourds to be used as sound boxes in acoustic musical instruments and the musical instruments that are made therefrom.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gourds, also known as hard shell gourds [Cucurbitaceae of the genera <i>Lagenaria </i>and <i>Cucurbita</i>], have been traditionally used in many cultures in the world. Immature gourds are used as an ingredient of many cultural dishes. In addition, various uses for the mature gourds also exist. Uses for cleaned, dried, and hollowed gourds include making bird feeders, decorative hats, bowls, or for food and water storage, known as calabash or water gourds.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the Hawaiian culture, the gourd is used, among other ways, to make percussion instruments known as the ipu-heke and the uli-uli. These instruments are often used for chanting and dancing in festivals and celebrations. Both of these musical instruments are made by cutting at least one mature gourd off at the neck and hollowing the gourd out.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ipu-heke is a double-chambered percussion instrument made with two of these hollowed gourds attached by the necks with a hole cut in the top gourd which allows the sound to escape. The uli-uli is a traditional Hawaiian rattle, made by inserting seeds or beads into hollowed-out gourd, which is then covered with a feather cap that prohibits the seeds from escaping. While gourds are used to make these musical instruments, the shapes of the instruments are dictated by the shape of the mature gourd.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ukulele is a small guitar-like stringed musical instrument that is associated with the Hawaiian culture. Ukuleles are commonly made of hard-woods such as koa, maple, mango, or pine. An example of a ukulele created using Hawaiian-hardwood and coconut shells is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,931 to Baker.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One disadvantage of manufacturing ukuleles from hard-woods is that hard-woods are difficult to shape, texture, and form. Because mature gourds do not naturally take the shape of a ukulele, much less a violin or guitar, ukuleles are not made out of gourds. Ukuleles can also be made from plastic materials, but the use of plastics is attached with a stigma of using an unnatural material made from petroleum. The sound quality of the instruments may also suffer by using plastic materials. The present invention teaches a method for making stringed musical instruments out of gourds, a renewable material which is easy to shape, texture, and form.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">French Patent No. 2625361 to Beltan details methods for manufacturing stringed musical instruments from gourds. However, similar to the ipu-heke and uli-uli, Beltan illustrates that when the resonating box is made from the gourd material, the shape of the instrument is dictated by the shape of the gourd used. Hence, musical instruments made using this method have a rounded gourd shape, making the instrument difficult to hold against the user's body. The gourd shape, which varies from plant to plant, determines the quality of the sound emanating from the instrument so made, rendering it impossible to achieve instruments offering consistent tonal qualities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Methods and apparatus for molding gourds during growth have been described for purposes other than the fabrication of musical instruments. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,096,507 to Czeszczicski, U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,639 to Ono, and Japan Pat. No. 1252230 to Aoyama, disclose methods and apparatuses for shaping immature gourds or fruits during growth for decorative purposes, and to facilitate fruit storage. The apparatus disclosed include two-part removable molds that rigidly enclose the growing fruit to produce decorative details on the fruit surface. Because these methods rigidly enclose the growing fruit, they do not allow overgrowth, requiring that the methods and apparatus be carefully watched as the fruit grows and fills the mold. Otherwise, compression damage to the fruit surface will result, or the fruit will rot if allowed to grow in the mold after the fruit fills the mold and begins to press the mold surface outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 4,827,666 to Tweddell attempts to address the overgrowth problem by teaching molds made from flexible materials that allow the mold to expand outwardly by bulging if the fruit is left in the mold after it has filled the mold cavity. Because the entire mold expands as the fruit grows, the size of resulting molded fruit will vary depending on how long the fruit is allowed to grow after it begins to press against the mold surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The prior art fails to offer a method of making acoustic instruments from gourds shaped in a manner conducive to sound boxes or resonating cavities, and that all for the fabrication of musical instruments that are comfortable to hold, easy to play, and produce tones that are of high quality and reproducible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">2. Objects and Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention teaches a method of manufacturing stringed musical instruments made from gourds that are molded during growth to a desired shape and size. Being able to mold gourds to any desired shape has several advantages. These advantages include having more flexibility to select and specify gourd shapes that, when used as a sound box in an acoustic instrument, produce better and more reproducible sound, tone, or quality, are aesthetically pleasing, and facilitate easier handling in a user's arms while the musical instrument is played.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also describes apparatus that provide a solution to the overgrowth problem when molding gourds during growth while still allowing those portions of the gourd within the mold to maintain a uniform size and shape.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, among the several objects and advantages of the present invention are: to provide a novel method for creating musical instruments from hard shell gourds; to provide new apparatus for shaping and molding immature gourds to be suitable for use as sound boxes in acoustic musical instruments; to provide a new acoustic musical instrument made of gourd having a molded flat back; to provide a new acoustic musical instrument with a superior tone and quality; to provide a new acoustic musical instrument that is aesthetically pleasing. Still other objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the ensuing description and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">The present invention is described below referring to the accompanying drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like or corresponding elements throughout. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description relating thereto are not intended to limit the claimed subject matter to the particular form or embodiment disclosed. Rather, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Method for Molding Gourds During Growth for Use</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">One aspect of the present invention is a method for molding gourds during growth in order to make the gourd suitable for use as a resonant cavity of an acoustic musical instrument. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a flow chart of the method for making musical instruments is presented in five steps: a growing step <b>10</b>, a harvesting step <b>40</b>, a finishing step <b>50</b>, and a constructing step <b>70</b>. Each of these steps is further explained below.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Growing Step</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">The first step of the present invention is growing step <b>10</b>. Growing step <b>10</b> begins with selecting the appropriate variety of a gourd plant <b>18</b>, which will produce a mature gourd <b>12</b>. In general, plants in the gourd family produce mature gourds that have a woody exterior <b>14</b> and a fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b>. Mature gourd <b>12</b> can be cut open, hollowed of fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b>, and dried to leave woody exterior <b>14</b> measuring from about &#x215b; inch to about &#xbd; inch in thickness. When mature, the gourds of the different gourd varieties are available in a variety of sizes and shapes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of gourd plant <b>18</b> with mature gourd <b>12</b> that has been cut in half to show its woody exterior <b>14</b> and its fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">When selecting the appropriate variety of gourd plant <b>18</b>, the anticipated mature gourd's size and shape must be matched with the intended use. For example, when making a tenor ukulele, a gourd variety that produces round mature gourd <b>12</b> with a volume and surface area larger than the expected body or the resonant cavity <b>74</b> of the ukulele should be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">Once the variety of gourd plant <b>18</b> is selected, gourd plant <b>18</b> is grown until an immature gourd <b>20</b> is produced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3B</figref> and <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>C illustrate the progression of growing step <b>10</b> using one preferred embodiment of a mold <b>24</b> of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</figref> illustrate the progression of growing step <b>10</b> using another preferred embodiment of mold <b>24</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>A, and <b>7</b>, gourd plant <b>18</b> is grown until immature gourd <b>20</b> is produced. Prior to reaching full maturity, immature gourd <b>20</b> is inserted into a mold cavity <b>22</b> of mold <b>24</b>. Immature gourd <b>20</b> should be inserted when it is smaller than mold cavity <b>22</b> so that immature gourd <b>20</b> is not damaged during its introduction into mold cavity <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">After immature gourd <b>20</b> is inserted into mold cavity <b>22</b>, immature gourd <b>20</b> is allowed to continue to grow in mold cavity <b>22</b>. As immature gourd <b>20</b> grows, immature gourd <b>20</b> fills and conforms to the shape of mold cavity <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, <b>4</b>B, and <b>5</b>B depict a molded gourd <b>36</b> of gourd plant <b>18</b> that has grown to fill and conform to the shape of mold cavity <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">After immature gourd <b>20</b> fills and conforms to the shape of mold cavity <b>22</b>, molded gourd <b>36</b> can be harvested immediately using harvesting step <b>40</b>. Alternatively, molded gourd <b>36</b> can remain in mold <b>24</b> and be allowed to continue to grow on gourd plant <b>18</b> before harvesting. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 5C</figref>, if molded gourd <b>36</b> is left in mold <b>24</b> and allowed to continue to grow on gourd plant <b>18</b> after it fills and conforms to mold cavity <b>22</b>, an excess growth <b>30</b> of molded gourd <b>36</b> will push outwardly from mold <b>24</b>. Excess growth <b>30</b> of molded gourd <b>36</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">At any time after immature gourd <b>20</b> is placed in mold <b>24</b> and prior to harvesting step <b>40</b>, one or more optional molding panels can be arranged to cover mold cavity <b>22</b> such that the molding panels will further mold and conform the portions of immature gourd <b>20</b> that comes into contact with the molding panel. A first molding panel <b>32</b> and a second molding panel <b>34</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>C, and <b>6</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref> thorough <b>5</b>C and <b>7</b> illustrate embodiments where only first molding panel <b>32</b> is present.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Harvesting Step</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">During harvesting step <b>40</b>, molded gourd <b>36</b> is cut from gourd plant <b>18</b>, removed from mold <b>24</b>. Next, molded gourd <b>36</b>, or a section thereof, is hollowed of its fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b>. In harvesting step <b>40</b>, a hole <b>42</b> can be cut in molded gourd <b>36</b> and fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b> is removed from the inside of molded gourd <b>36</b> through hole <b>42</b>. Alternatively, molded gourd <b>36</b> can be cut into one or more pieces and fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b> is removed from each of the pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C</figref>, <b>4</b>D and <b>5</b>D are examples of three molded gourds <b>36</b> that have been harvested by cutting from gourd plant <b>18</b> and removing from mold <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, molded gourd <b>36</b> has three surfaces&#x2014;a first flat surface <b>46</b><i>a </i>and a second flat surface <b>46</b><i>b, </i>and a curved surface <b>46</b><i>c. </i>In this embodiment, during the harvesting step, hole <b>42</b> would be cut on first flat surface <b>46</b><i>a </i>and fleshy pulp interior <b>16</b> is removed from molded gourd <b>36</b> through hole <b>42</b> until only woody exterior <b>14</b> remains.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to agricultural harvesters such as combines, and, more particularly, to cleaning systems used in such combines.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An agricultural harvester known as a &#x201c;combine&#x201d; is historically termed such because it combines multiple harvesting functions with a single harvesting unit, such as picking, threshing, separating and cleaning A combine includes a header which removes the crop from a field, and a feeder housing which transports the crop matter into a threshing rotor. The threshing rotor rotates within a perforated housing, which may be in the form of adjustable concaves and performs a threshing operation on the crop to remove the grain. Once the grain is threshed it falls through perforations in the concaves onto a grain pan. From the grain pan the grain is cleaned using a cleaning system, and is then transported to a grain tank onboard the combine. A cleaning fan blows air through the sieves to discharge chaff and other debris toward the rear of the combine. Non-grain crop material, such as straw, from the threshing section proceeds through a residue system, which may utilize a straw chopper to process the non-grain material and direct it out the rear of the combine. When the grain tank becomes full, the combine is positioned adjacent a vehicle into which the grain is to be unloaded, such as a semi-trailer, gravity box, straight truck, or the like; and an unloading system on the combine is actuated to transfer the grain into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More particularly, a rotary threshing or separating system includes one or more rotors which can extend axially (front to rear) or transversely within the body of the combine, and which are partially or fully surrounded by a perforated concave. The crop material is threshed and separated by the rotation of the rotor within the concave. Coarser non-grain crop material such as stalks and leaves are transported to the rear of the combine and discharged back to the field. The separated grain, together with some finer non-grain crop material such as chaff, dust, straw, and other crop residue are discharged through the concaves and fall onto a grain pan where they are transported to a cleaning system. Alternatively, the grain and finer non-grain crop material may also fall directly onto the cleaning system itself</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A cleaning system further separates the grain from non-grain crop material, and typically includes a fan directing an airflow stream upwardly and rearwardly through vertically arranged sieves which oscillate in a fore and aft manner. The airflow stream lifts and carries the lighter non-grain crop material towards the rear end of the combine for discharge to the field. Clean grain, being heavier, and larger pieces of non-grain crop material, which are not carried away by the airflow stream, fall onto a surface of an upper sieve (also known as a chaffer sieve) where some or all of the clean grain passes through to a lower sieve (also known as a cleaning sieve). Grain and non-grain crop material remaining on the upper and lower sieves are physically separated by the reciprocating action of the sieves as the material moves rearwardly. Any grain and/or non-grain crop material remaining on the top surface of the upper sieve are discharged at the rear of the combine. Grain falling through the lower sieve lands on a bottom pan of the cleaning system, where it is conveyed forwardly toward a clean grain auger.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the paper entitled, &#x201c;Cleaning Shoe Air Velocities in Combine Harvesting of Wheat&#x201d;, published in the <i>American Society of Agricultural Engineers </i>(Volume 29(4): July-August 1986), it is discussed that thermistors were used as sensors heating them well above ambient temperature. And that the resistance change caused by the cooling effect of the air was sensed by measuring the voltage drop across each thermistor. This can be problematic with the sensors being the hottest when the airflow is the lowest, such as when crop material may be lodged against the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cleaning system of prior art harvesters have certain adjustments that can be made, which for the most part are static during the harvesting operation, and there is a lack of information about the airflow in the cleaning system so that adequate airflow adjustments can be made.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed in the art is an airflow control system that can monitor and adjust the airflow profile in a dynamic fashion as the combine is harvesting crops.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a system and method of measuring and controlling an airflow profile in a cleaning system of a combine as harvesting of a crop is underway.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention in one form is directed to an agricultural harvesting system including a chassis, an agricultural product moving device coupled to the chassis, an airflow system, a cleaning system and an airflow characterizing system. The airflow system includes a fan, and is coupled to the chassis. The cleaning system is coupled to the chassis, and is configured to receive the agricultural product from the moving device. The cleaning system is configured to receive an airflow from the airflow system. The airflow characterizing system is at least partially positioned in the airflow, and is configured to measure an airflow profile across the cleaning system. The airflow characterizing system includes a plurality of sensors that determine airflow by measuring a thermal transfer from the sensors to the airflow. The airflow characterizing system being configured to maintain a substantially constant electrical resistance of the sensors as the airflow varies.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention in another form is directed to an airflow control system used in an agricultural harvesting system. The airflow control system including an airflow generating system and an airflow characterizing system. The airflow generating system includes a fan configured to generate an airflow.

The airflow characterizing system is configured to maintain a substantially constant electrical resistance of the sensors as the airflow varies.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention in yet another form is directed to a method of controlling airflow in a cleaning system of an agricultural harvesting system. The method includes the steps of generating an airflow in the cleaning system, and characterizing the airflow. The airflow in the cleaning system is characterized with an airflow characterizing system by the execution of the steps of measuring and creating. The measuring step measures portions of the airflow with a plurality of sensors, with each of the sensors producing a signal representative of a thermal transfer from the sensor to the airflow. The airflow characterizing system is configured to maintain a substantially constant electrical resistance of the sensors as the airflow varies. The creating step creates an airflow profile across the cleaning system.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views. The exemplification set out herein illustrates embodiments of the invention, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The terms &#x201c;grain&#x201d;, &#x201c;straw&#x201d; and &#x201c;tailings&#x201d; are used principally throughout this specification for convenience but it is to be understood that these terms are not intended to be limiting. Thus &#x201c;grain&#x201d; refers to that part of the crop material which is threshed and separated from the discardable part of the crop material, which is referred to as non-grain crop material, MOG or straw. Incompletely threshed crop material is referred to as &#x201c;tailings&#x201d;. Also the terms &#x201c;forward&#x201d;, &#x201c;rearward&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d; and &#x201c;right&#x201d;, when used in connection with the agricultural harvester and/or components thereof are usually determined with reference to the direction of forward operative travel of the harvester, but again, they should not be construed as limiting. The terms &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; and &#x201c;transverse&#x201d; are determined with reference to the fore-and-aft direction of the agricultural harvester and are equally not to be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown an agricultural harvester in the form of a combine <b>10</b>, which generally includes a chassis <b>12</b>, ground engaging wheels <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, a header <b>18</b>, a feeder housing <b>20</b>, an operator cab <b>22</b>, a threshing and separating system <b>24</b>, a cleaning system <b>26</b>, a grain tank <b>28</b>, and an unloading auger <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Front wheels <b>14</b> are larger flotation type wheels, and rear wheels <b>16</b> are smaller steerable wheels. Motive force is selectively applied to front wheels <b>14</b> through a power plant in the form of a diesel engine <b>32</b> and a transmission (not shown). Although combine <b>10</b> is shown as including wheels, is also to be understood that combine <b>10</b> may include tracks, such as full tracks or half tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Header <b>18</b> is mounted to the front of combine <b>10</b> and includes a cutter bar <b>34</b> for severing crops from a field during forward motion of combine <b>10</b>. A rotatable reel <b>36</b> feeds the crop into header <b>18</b>, and a double auger <b>38</b> feeds the severed crop laterally inwardly from each side toward feeder housing <b>20</b>. Feeder housing <b>20</b> conveys the cut crop to threshing and separating system <b>24</b>, and is selectively vertically movable using appropriate actuators, such as hydraulic cylinders (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Threshing and separating system <b>24</b> is of the axial-flow type, and generally includes a rotor <b>40</b> at least partially enclosed by and rotatable within a corresponding perforated concave <b>42</b>. The cut crops are threshed and separated by the rotation of rotor <b>40</b> within concave <b>42</b>, and larger elements, such as stalks, leaves and the like are discharged from the rear of combine <b>10</b>. Smaller elements of crop material including grain and non-grain crop material, including particles lighter than grain, such as chaff, dust and straw, are discharged through perforations of concave <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Grain which has been separated by the threshing and separating assembly <b>24</b> falls onto a grain pan <b>44</b> and is conveyed toward cleaning system <b>26</b>. Cleaning system <b>26</b> may include an optional pre-cleaning sieve <b>46</b>, an upper sieve <b>48</b> (also known as a chaffer sieve), a lower sieve <b>50</b> (also known as a cleaning sieve), and a cleaning fan <b>52</b>. Grain on sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> is subjected to a cleaning action by fan <b>52</b> which provides an airflow through the sieves to remove chaff and other impurities such as dust from the grain by making this material airborne for discharge from straw hood <b>54</b> of combine <b>10</b>. Grain pan <b>44</b> and pre-cleaning sieve <b>46</b> oscillate in a fore-to-aft manner to transport the grain and finer non-grain crop material to the upper surface of upper sieve <b>48</b>. Upper sieve <b>48</b> and lower sieve <b>50</b> are vertically arranged relative to each other, and likewise oscillate in a fore-to-aft manner to spread the grain across sieves <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, while permitting the passage of cleaned grain by gravity through the openings of sieves <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Clean grain falls to a clean grain auger <b>56</b> positioned crosswise below and in front of lower sieve <b>50</b>. Clean grain auger <b>56</b> receives clean grain from each sieve <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and from bottom pan <b>58</b> of cleaning system <b>26</b>. Clean grain auger <b>56</b> conveys the clean grain laterally to a generally vertically arranged grain elevator <b>60</b> for transport to grain tank <b>28</b>. Tailings from cleaning system <b>26</b> fall to a tailings auger trough <b>62</b>. The tailings are transported via tailings auger <b>64</b> and return auger <b>66</b> to the upstream end of cleaning system <b>26</b> for repeated cleaning action. A pair of grain tank augers <b>68</b> at the bottom of grain tank <b>28</b> convey the clean grain laterally within grain tank <b>28</b> to unloading auger <b>30</b> for discharge from combine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The non-grain crop material proceeds through a residue handling system <b>70</b>. Residue handling system <b>70</b> may include a chopper, counter knives, a windrow door and a residue spreader.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> there is shown an airflow characterizing system <b>72</b> (illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) having a controller <b>74</b>, airflow alteration devices <b>76</b>, a temperature sensor <b>78</b> and a sensor grid <b>80</b> or <b>80</b>&#x2032;. Two embodiments of the present invention are illustrated, one being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> and another in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Controller <b>74</b>, while shown as a standalone controller, will likely have its functions incorporated into a controller that performs other functions in combine <b>10</b>. Temperature sensor <b>78</b> is used to measure the temperature of an airflow <b>84</b> or <b>84</b>&#x2032; and that temperature is used by controller <b>74</b> to determine the heat dissipation of sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032; that make up sensor grid <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>&#x2032;, to thereby arrive at an airflow detected by each sensor <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032; and the measured airflow profile.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Sensor grid <b>80</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> where sensor grid <b>80</b> is positioned in an airflow <b>84</b>. Airflow <b>84</b> originates by the action of fan <b>52</b> and it is used in cleaning system <b>26</b> to clean the grain. Sensor grid <b>80</b> is a grid of sensors <b>82</b> that are generally arranged in a plane that is substantially normal to the direction of airflow <b>84</b>. Although the positioning of sensors <b>82</b> is illustrated as being generally ordered in regularly spaced intervals, other positions within the grid are also contemplated. Airflow <b>84</b> is detected by sensors <b>82</b> and this information is provided to controller <b>74</b> so that the measured airflow profile across cleaning system <b>26</b> is established, so that the airflow profile can be altered by airflow alteration device <b>76</b>. Airflow alteration device <b>76</b> can also be understood to be an airflow adjusting system <b>76</b> that can consist of a variety of passive and active device that can alter characteristics of airflow <b>84</b> as it passes through cleaning system <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Sensor grid <b>80</b>&#x2032; is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where sensor grid <b>80</b>&#x2032; is positioned in an airflow <b>84</b>&#x2032;, which is generally perpendicular to sieve <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. Airflow <b>84</b>&#x2032; is schematically shown at an angle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to show that the airflow as it goes through sieve <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> is angled upwardly. Airflow <b>84</b>&#x2032; originates by the action of fan <b>52</b> and it is used in cleaning system <b>26</b> to clean the grain. Sensor grid <b>80</b>&#x2032; is a grid of sensors <b>82</b>&#x2032; that are generally arranged in a plane that is substantially normal to the direction of airflow <b>84</b>&#x2032;. Sensors <b>82</b>&#x2032; are coupled to fins of sieve <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> or <b>50</b>, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A sensor <b>82</b>&#x2032; is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with a thermistor in distal end <b>86</b>&#x2032;. The thermistor is positioned, so that the heat conduction in the assembly and to the surrounding air is known, and generally, even substantially, consistent between sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032; in respective grids <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>&#x2032;. Although the positioning of sensors <b>82</b>&#x2032; is illustrated as being generally ordered in regularly spaced intervals, other positions within the grid are also contemplated. Airflow <b>84</b>&#x2032; is detected by sensors <b>82</b>&#x2032; and this information is provided to controller <b>74</b>, in the form of a signal that is related to heat transfer to the surrounding air, so that an airflow profile across cleaning system <b>26</b> is established, allowing controller <b>74</b> to alter the airflow, and hence the airflow profile, by way of airflow alteration device <b>76</b>, which can also be understood to be an airflow adjusting system <b>76</b> that can consist of a variety of passive and active device that can alter characteristics of airflow <b>84</b>&#x2032; as it passes through cleaning system <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While the present invention could use both a grid <b>80</b> and a grid <b>80</b>&#x2032; on one or more of sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> or <b>50</b>, for the ease of discussion, it will be assumed that just one grid <b>80</b> or <b>80</b>&#x2032; will be used in a combine <b>10</b>. The measured airflow profile can be understood to provide a distribution of airflows that controller <b>74</b> seeks to optimize, as compared to a selected airflow profile that is selected based on grain and material other than grain (MOG) characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The operational parameters of the combine harvester cleaning system <b>26</b> are dependent on the characteristics of the air flowing in cleaning system <b>26</b>. The present invention uses multiple sensors <b>82</b> or <b>82</b>&#x2032; respectively arranged in sensor grids <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>&#x2032; to measure characteristics of air passing through cleaning system <b>26</b> and more particularly sieve <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> for the purpose of defining the operational efficiency of cleaning system <b>26</b>. Airflow characterizing system <b>72</b> provides meaningful data that can be considered to be an airflow profile output under the circumstances associated with collecting data while combine <b>10</b> is operational. The meaningful data is used by controller <b>74</b> to control various settings within combine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During harvesting operations, and airflow system <b>52</b>&#x2032; that includes fan <b>52</b> is used to generate a volume of high velocity air which is strategically blown through cleaning system sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> to provide an air blast for pneumatic separation of grain from MOG. The purpose of the air blast is to assist the mechanical separation of grain and MOG. Sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> are physically very large assemblies positioned within combine <b>10</b>. During operation, sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> reciprocate back and forth at a frequency of about 4.5 Hz (with some combines operating at frequencies between 3.3 and 5.8 Hz). Due to the motion and location of sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>50</b>, as well as taking into account the dirty conditions and volume of crop passing over the sieves, there is no system in the prior art to measure the characteristics of the air flowing through sieves <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. The present invention has the ability to identify the overall airflow characteristics for the entire area of a sieve, thereby allowing the settings of combine <b>10</b> to be continually optimized. In the prior art, without knowing the airflow characteristics in the cleaning system, the settings of the combine are not able to be adjusted to optimize the cleaning system performance. The optimum settings for a given crop condition are difficult to determine without knowing the airflow characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Generally, in the prior art, the settings are held constant even as crop conditions change, causing the cleaning system to never be optimized and even if the settings were good for one crop condition, with changes to the crop condition causing the cleaning system performance to decrease. The settings are held constant because optimizing the settings without knowing the airflow characteristics is not practical.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present invention a series of sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032;, such as in the form of thermistors, are placed in cleaning system <b>26</b> to quantify the spatial air velocity in cleaning system <b>26</b>. The type of sensors might include, but are not limited to, thermistors, and could among other types include: hot wire anemometers, vane anemometers, pitot tube pressure transducers, etc. For purposes of discussion the preferred embodiment will be considered to be thermistors, with the thermistors being located at a distal end <b>86</b>, <b>86</b>&#x2032; of sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032;. The locations that sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032; could be positioned within combine <b>10</b> include, but are not limited to, the inlet or outlet of cleaning fan <b>52</b> or other fans, between the sieve louvers, on the chaffer, or shoe sieve, between the chaffer and shoe sieve, below the shoe sieve or above the chaffer sieve.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The signal from sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032; (thermistors) is used to quantify the local air velocity, at the sensor's location. The optimum air pattern in cleaning system <b>26</b> for a given crop and condition is established, prior to harvesting, either by an empirical, analytical or stochastic model or some combination thereof to identify what the optimum air pattern in cleaning system <b>26</b> should be. A significant aspect of the present invention is the ability use sensors <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032; so that they can accurately depict the characteristics of the airflow being measured in combine <b>10</b> during operation. Airflow characterizing system <b>72</b> is used while crop is being processed by cleaning system <b>26</b> to identify and to adjust for the optimum air distribution in cleaning system <b>26</b>. Additionally, airflow characterizing system <b>72</b> can be used while the cleaning system is not processing crops to provide design engineers with information regarding the airflow distribution in the system. The airflow distribution is used to identify design changes to cleaning system <b>26</b> and to identify the optimum no-crop-load air distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The use of thermistors by the present invention, relative to both crop airflow and non-crop airflow measurements, is the technique used to quantify the air velocity with the thermistors. There are at least two ways in which a thermistor is used to quantify air velocity by the present invention. First, the thermistor is electrically placed in series with a precision resistor and the circuit is subject to a constant excitation, with the variation in current through the resistor and thermistor being monitored, which is representative of heat transfer to the airflow and hence of the velocity of the airflow past the sensor. With a known air temperature, the heat transfer from the thermistor is mathematically related to the airflow past sensor <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032;. The second approach uses a feedback control loop to maintain a constant resistance in the thermistor, with the control loop characteristics then providing a signal that is related to the heat transfer of the thermistor and thus the airflow past the thermistor.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Both techniques require the relationship between the heat transfer from the thermistor to the air to be quantified, as this relationship allows the air velocity to be indirectly measured. For purposes of the present invention, the second technique is considered the preferred method. The first technique results in the sensor being hottest when the air velocity past the thermistor is at a minimum. This could occur if there was a buildup of MOG on the thermistor. Having dry MOG against a thermistor, which could reach temperatures in excess of 100&#xb0; C., could be undesirable, at least resulting in sensor failure. The advantage of the preferred second system, with the constant resistance thermistor, is that the thermistor temperature is held constant, regardless of the air velocity past the thermistor, thereby mitigating overheating risk. This particular system maintains a nearly constant resistive value for the sensor <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>&#x2032;, hence keeping the thermistor at a generally constant temperature. Controller <b>74</b> alters the current flow through the thermistor (or the voltage across the thermistor) to maintain the thermistor resistance value. The controlled current flow is the signal that relates to the heat transfer to the air from the thermistor, and hence is representative of the airflow past the thermistor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The airflow velocity in cleaning system <b>26</b> is affected by the amount, or load of crop in cleaning system <b>26</b>. By having sensor grid <b>80</b>, <b>80</b>&#x2032; to provide several airflow measurements, the airflow profile across the cleaning system, several forms of adjustment can be made by control system <b>72</b> to improve efficiency of cleaning system <b>26</b>. To effectively control the airflow profile in cleaning system <b>26</b> a number of adjustments can be made by airflow adjusting system <b>76</b> to achieve the optimum air pattern, including but not limited to: 1. Divert the air in the system, for example, a series or grid of rotatable louvers, or vanes can be added in front of, or below, sieve <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, in the fan ductwork, and or between the upper and lower sieves. The louvers are used to modify the spatial distribution or pattern of airflow in cleaning system <b>26</b> as well as the average air velocity. 2. Change the speed of the cleaning fan. 3. Varying the opening size of the inlet and or outlet of cleaning fan <b>52</b>. 4. The sieve slat openings could be adjusted (opened more or opened less). 5. Additional fans can be added to cleaning system <b>52</b>, which are turned off/on/sped up/slowed down. 6. The oscillation frequency of cleaning system <b>26</b> can also be adjusted. 7. The sieve motion (stroke length, angle of inclination, angle of oscillation) can be modified. 8. Air exhaust ports can be open/closed. 9. The ground speed of combine <b>10</b> can be slowed down or sped up.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention has certain advantages including improved cleaning system performance allowing cleaning system <b>26</b> to be able to more effectively separate grain from MOG. Further, the feedback from airflow characterizing system <b>72</b> can be used by either the operator to adjust elements of combine <b>10</b> and/or it could be used in conjunction with control software to allow combine <b>10</b> to make autonomous adjustments of combine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While this invention has been described with respect to at least one embodiment, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.</p>

<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a bale wrapper, and the invention also relates to a combined baler/bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Combined baler/bale wrappers for forming and wrapping a bale of material are known. Such combined baler/bale wrappers are commonly used in the harvesting of forage material, such as, for example, grass, hay, straw and the like, and in particular, are used in the harvesting of grass to produce silage. Such baler/bale wrappers, in general, comprise a baler within which cylindrical bales are sequentially produced. Such bales are typically of length of approximately 1.25 metres and diameter in the range of 0.9 metre to 2.2 metres, and more typically of diameter in the range of 1.2 metres to 1.6 metres. The baler is mounted on a chassis. A bale wrapper for wrapping the formed bales sequentially with wrapping material, typically a wrapping film of plastics material, is mounted on the chassis to the rear of the baler for receiving the formed bales from the baler. Grass lying in swards in a field is picked up by a forwardly extending pick-up mechanism of the baler and delivered into a bale forming chamber of the baler where the cylindrical bale is formed. The formed cylindrical bale is then transferred from the baler onto the bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically the bale wrapper is a two-axis bale wrapper, and in general, the bale is supported on and rotated by a pair of parallel spaced apart bale support rollers about a first wrapping axis which coincides with the longitudinally extending main central geometrical axis of the bale. At least one and commonly two wrapping film dispensers are revolved around the bale about a second wrapping axis as the bale is being rotated about the first wrapping axis for dispensing wrapping film onto the bale for wrapping thereof. The second wrapping axis extends substantially perpendicularly relative to the first wrapping axis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a combined baler/bale wrapper is disclosed in PCT published Application Specification No. WO 02/076183.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Balers for producing cylindrical bales of forage material of selectable diameter are known. Such balers are commonly referred to as belt balers and comprise a plurality of side by side belts supported on fixed position rotatably mounted rollers and rotatably mounted tensioning rollers configured to define a bale forming chamber which increases in diameter as the bale is being formed. The belts are driven by one or more of the fixed position rollers in order to rotate the bale as the bale is being formed in the bale forming chamber. The belts are tensioned by the tensioning rollers in order to compress the forage material tightly as the bale is being rotated and formed. By monitoring the position of one or more of the tensioning rollers or the tension in the belts, the diameter of the bale being formed at any given time can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Balers are being developed for producing bales of ever increasing diameter, and accordingly, bale wrappers for wrapping bales must be capable of wrapping such bales of increasing diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bale wrappers of the type disclosed in PCT published Application Specification No. WO 02/076183 comprise a pair of spaced apart bale support rollers which support and rotate the bale about a first wrapping axis, which coincides with the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis of the bale. One or a pair of wrapping film dispensers are carried on a carrier element which revolves the wrapping film dispensers around the rotating bale about a second wrapping axis for dispensing wrapping film onto the bale as the bale is rotated about the first wrapping axis. As discussed above, the second wrapping axis extends substantially perpendicularly relative to the first wrapping axis. In the bale wrapper disclosed in PCT published Specification No. WO 02/076183 the carrier element comprises a carrier ring which extends in a substantially vertical plane and defines the second wrapping axis which extends perpendicularly to the plane defined by the carrier ring and substantially horizontally. The carrier ring is rotated about the second wrapping axis for revolving the wrapping film dispensers about the second wrapping axis. The carrier ring is located relative to the bale support rollers on which the bale is rotated about the first wrapping axis with the plane defined by the carrier ring located intermediate the bale support rollers and with the first wrapping axis contained in a substantially vertical plane spaced apart from but relatively close to the plane defined by the carrier ring.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the wrapping film dispensers must pass both above and below the bale supported on the bale support rollers, the headroom available for the bale on the bale support rollers is limited and confined by both the carrier ring and by the wrapping film dispensers as the wrapping film dispensers pass above the bale between the bale and the carrier ring. Additionally, the headroom available to the bale is particularly limited by the carrier ring as the bale is being transferred onto the bale support rollers, particularly if the carrier ring is disposed closer to the forward bale support roller than the rearward bale support roller relative to normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is desirable that even with the limited available headroom in such bale wrappers, such bale wrappers should be capable of wrapping bales of increasing diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, in other such bale wrappers where one or more wrapping film dispensers are mounted on a carrier element and are revolved around the rotating bale such that the carrier element or the wrapping film dispensers as they are revolved around the rotating bale define a locus of travel which lies in a substantially horizontal plane, or a plane which lies no more than thirty degrees to the horizontal, a problem also arises where such bale wrappers are required to wrap bales of increasing diameter. It is desirable that the wrapping film as it is being dispensed from the wrapping film dispensers onto the bale should be substantially centrally aligned with the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis of the rotating bale. In other words, it is desirable that a longitudinally extending centre line of the wrapping film should coincide with the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis of the rotating bale as the wrapping film is being applied to the bale. In such bale wrappers, the bale wrappers are provided to wrap bales of a specific diameter. If a bale of greater or lesser diameter than the specific diameter for which the bale wrapper is designed is being wrapped on such a bale wrapper, the level of the central geometrical axis of the bale when supported on the bale support rollers will be at a level above or below the level at which the central geometrical axis of a bale of the specific diameter would be supported. Accordingly, the longitudinally extending centre line of the wrapping film will not coincide with the central geometrical axis of such bales of greater or lesser diameter than the specific diameter when the wrapping film is being applied to such bales. This is undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is therefore a need for a bale wrapper which addresses at least some of the above discussed problems. There is also a need for a combined baler/bale wrapper for producing wrapped bales of varying diameter and also of selectable diameters which addresses at least some of the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is directed towards providing such a bale wrapper and the invention is also directed towards providing such combined baler/bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention there is provided a bale wrapper for wrapping a bale of material, the bale wrapper comprising a chassis, rotatably mounted substantially parallel spaced apart first and second bale support rollers operable in a bale wrapping state for supporting the bale and for rotating the bale about a first wrapping axis during wrapping of the bale, a transfer means for transferring a bale onto the bale wrapper, the transfer means being operable from a first state for receiving a bale thereon to a second state for transferring the bale onto the bale wrapper, the first bale support roller being located on the transfer means and being moveable relative to and independently of the second bale support roller in a generally downwardly direction from the bale wrapping state as the transfer means is operated from the first state to the second state for minimising the headroom required by the bale as the bale is being transferred by the transfer means to the bale wrapper.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously, the transfer means is pivotal about a transfer pivot axis between the first state and the second state.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one aspect of the invention the transfer means comprises a receiving means for receiving a bale to be transferred to the bale wrapper. Preferably, the receiving means is located to one side of the transfer pivot axis, and the first bale support roller is located to the other side of the transfer pivot axis, so that as the transfer means is being pivoted from the first state to the second state, the receiving means is urged in a generally upwardly direction, and the first bale support roller is urged in the generally downward direction from the bale wrapping state. Advantageously, the receiving means comprises a pair of spaced apart carrier members carried on the transfer means.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the carrier members extend parallel to each other and are spaced apart from and are parallel to the transfer pivot axis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the receiving means is configured relative to the first bale support roller so that as the transfer means is being operated from the first state to the second state, the bale is displaced onto the first bale support roller.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the second rotational axis defined by the second bale support roller and the transfer pivot axis are located on respective opposite sides of the first rotational axis defined by the first bale support roller.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another aspect of the invention the transfer means is pivotally mounted on the chassis about the transfer pivot axis, and the second bale support roller is rotatably mounted on the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the transfer pivot axis is located at a level below a plane containing the first and second rotational axes defined by the first and second bale support rollers when the first bale support roller is in the bale wrapping state.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, the first bale support roller is configured on the transfer means so that when the transfer means is in the second state, the first bale support roller is in a maximum downwardly displaced state at its maximum spacing below a horizontal plane containing the second rotational axis defined by the second bale support roller.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one aspect of the invention a first urging means is provided for urging the transfer means between the first and second states.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another aspect of the invention a first drive means is provided for driving at least one of the first and second bale support rollers for in turn rotating the bale supported on the first and second bale support rollers about the first wrapping axis.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another aspect of the invention a carrier means is provided for carrying and guiding at least one wrapping material dispenser along a locus of travel about a second wrapping axis for dispensing wrapping material onto the bale as the bale is being rotated on the first and second bale support rollers about the first wrapping axis, the second wrapping axis extending relative to the first wrapping axis at an angle greater than zero.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the second wrapping axis extends substantially perpendicularly relative to the first wrapping axis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Advantageously, the carrier means defines a carrier plane containing the locus of travel through which the at least one wrapping material dispenser is guided by the carrier means about the second wrapping axis. Preferably, the second wrapping axis extends substantially perpendicularly to the carrier plane.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one aspect of the invention the carrier plane extends in one of a generally upwardly direction extending parallel with or coinciding with a vertical plane containing the first wrapping axis, a generally upwardly inclined direction inclining upwardly relative to the vertical plane containing the first wrapping axis in a general direction towards the first bale support roller, and a generally upwardly inclined direction relative to the vertical plane containing the first wrapping axis in a general direction towards the second bale support roller.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a further aspect of the invention the baler comprises a belt baler.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The advantages of the invention are many. In particular, the bale wrapper and the combined baler/bale wrapper according to the invention permit the wrapping of bales of diameter greater than those which could otherwise be wrapped on known bale wrappers and on the bale wrappers of combined baler/bale wrappers. By virtue of the fact that the first bale support roller is located on the transfer means so that as the transfer means is transferring a bale onto the bale wrapper, the first bale support roller is moved in a generally downwardly direction, the headroom available to the bale as the bale is being transferred over the first bale support roller onto the bale wrapper is maximised. By providing one of the first and second bale support rollers to be moveable relative to the other one of the first and second bale support rollers into selectable ones of a plurality of bale wrapping states, the bale wrapping state of the moveable one of the first and second bale support rollers can be selected in order to suit the diameter of the bale to be wrapped in order to provide the appropriate headroom for the bale as the bale is being wrapped on the bale wrapper. When the bale wrapper is provided as part of a combined baler/bale wrapper and the bale wrapper is provided with both the transfer means and one of the first and second bale support rollers being moveable relative to the other one of the first and second bale support rollers into a plurality of selectable bale wrapping states, a particularly important advantage of the invention is achieved in that the headroom available for transferring the bale by the transfer means onto the bale wrapper is maximised, and the headroom available during wrapping of the bale on the bale wrapper can also be maximised.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, by virtue of the fact that the moveable one of the first and second bale support rollers is moveable relative to the other one of the first and second bale support rollers into a plurality of selectable bale wrapping states, bales of different diameters can be supported on the bale support rollers with the level of the central geometrical axis of the supported bale being substantially constant or within relatively narrow upper and lower limits, so that in bale wrappers in which the locus through which the wrapping film dispenser or wrapping film dispensers are being revolved around the second wrapping axis defines a substantially horizontal plane, or a plane inclined at an angle of up to 30&#xb0; to the horizontal, the wrapping film will be applied to the bale with the longitudinally extending centre line of the wrapping film substantially coinciding with the central geometrical axis of the bale.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A particularly important advantage of the invention is achieved when the combined baler/bale wrapper is provided with the bale wrapper according to the invention which comprises the transfer element with the first bale support roller mounted on the transfer element, in that the baler can be mounted on the chassis at a lower level relative to the bale wrapper than balers can be mounted relative to bale wrappers of combined baler/baler wrappers known heretofore. This is due to the fact that the transfer element is locatable at a lower level relative to the bale wrapper than the transfer elements of bale wrappers known heretofore, and therefore, the baler can be mounted on the chassis at a lower level relative to the bale wrapper, and the bale can still be discharged by the baler under gravity onto the transfer element of the bale wrapper when the transfer element is in the first state. It is the fact that the first bale support roller is mounted on the transfer element, and the fact that as the transfer element is pivoting upwardly from the first state to the second state to transfer the bale onto the bale wrapper, the first bale support roller is urged downwardly from the bale wrapping state which permits the transfer element in the first state to be located at a considerably lower level relative to the bale wrapper than transfer elements can be located relative to bale wrappers known heretofore. Additionally, the fact that the transfer element in the first state is located at a lower level than transfer elements of bale wrappers known heretofore provides a further advantage in that the spacing required between the baler and the bale wrapper to accommodate pivoting of the transfer element from the first state to the second state can be significantly reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Before describing the bale wrapper <b>14</b> and the transfer element <b>16</b> in detail, the baler <b>10</b> will first be described.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The baler <b>10</b> comprises a housing <b>18</b> which is formed by a forward stationary part <b>19</b> and a rearwardly moveable part, which forms a rear door <b>20</b>. The stationary part <b>19</b> comprises a pair of opposite spaced apart side walls <b>21</b> which extend upwardly from the chassis <b>5</b>. The rear door <b>20</b> comprises a pair of opposite spaced apart side walls <b>23</b> which are secured together by bracing bars <b>24</b> extending between the side walls <b>23</b>. The spacing between the side walls <b>23</b> of the rear door <b>20</b> is substantially similar to the spacing between the side walls <b>21</b> of the stationary part <b>19</b>. A pivot shaft <b>25</b> extending between and carried on the side walls <b>21</b> adjacent a top portion <b>26</b> thereof defines a door pivot axis <b>28</b>, and the rear door <b>20</b> is pivotally carried on the pivot shaft <b>25</b> and is pivotal about the door pivot axis <b>28</b> in the directions of the arrows A and B between a closed state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> during forming of a bale in the baler <b>10</b>, and an open state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref> for accommodating discharge of a formed bale <b>2</b> from the baler <b>10</b> onto the transfer element <b>16</b>. A pair of main hydraulic rams <b>27</b> illustrated only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 15</figref> acting between the rear door <b>20</b> and the stationary part <b>19</b> pivot the rear door <b>20</b> between the open and the closed states.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A plurality of side by side belts <b>29</b>, only one of which is illustrated in the drawings, are carried around fixed position driven rollers <b>30</b>, fixed position idler rollers <b>31</b> and tensioning rollers <b>32</b> for forming a bale <b>2</b> in the baler <b>10</b>.

The tensioning rollers <b>32</b> are rotatably carried on shafts <b>39</b> which extend rigidly between the tensioning arms <b>37</b> for securing the tensioning arms <b>37</b> together. Two pairs of tensioning springs <b>36</b> acting between the tensioning arms <b>37</b> and the door <b>20</b> on respective opposite sides of the baler <b>10</b> tension the tensioning arms <b>37</b> to induce tension in the belts <b>29</b> in order to compact the forage material as the bale is being formed. The tensioning springs <b>36</b> act on the tensioning arms <b>37</b> to urge the tensioning arms <b>37</b> in the direction of the arrow C about the pivot shaft <b>25</b> to take up slack in the belts <b>29</b> while the bale is being formed in the baler <b>10</b>, and in turn to compact the forage material as the bale is being formed. This aspect of the belt baler will be understood by those skilled in the art. A pair of tensioning rams <b>38</b> acting between the door and corresponding connector elements <b>33</b>, which couple the tensioning springs <b>36</b> to the tensioning arms <b>37</b>, provide for adjustment of the tension induced in the belts <b>29</b> by the tensioning springs <b>36</b>.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The side walls <b>21</b> of the stationary part <b>19</b> of the baler <b>10</b> define a rearwardly facing open mouth <b>45</b> for accommodating discharge of a formed bale <b>2</b> from the bale forming chamber <b>42</b> when the rear door <b>20</b> is in the open state. The open mouth <b>45</b> defines a plane <b>46</b> which extends transversely of the normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b>, and is generally upwardly forwardly inclined relative to a transverse substantially vertically extending plane <b>47</b>. In this embodiment of the invention the inclined plane <b>46</b> defined by the open mouth <b>45</b> defines an angle &#x3b1; with the vertical plane <b>47</b> of approximately 5&#xb0;, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">It has been found that by locating the stationary part <b>19</b> of the baler <b>10</b> with the open mouth <b>45</b> defined by the stationary part <b>19</b> defining the plane <b>46</b> which inclines in a generally upwardly forwardly direction at the angle &#x3b1; of approximately 5&#xb0; to the vertical plane <b>47</b> optimises the clearance between the stationary part <b>19</b> of the baler <b>10</b> and the bale wrapper <b>14</b> which is required in order to facilitate pivoting of the rear door <b>20</b> between the closed state and the open state, while at the same time not inhibiting discharge of a bale <b>2</b> from the bale forming chamber <b>42</b> onto the transfer element <b>16</b>. However, it will be appreciated that if the spacing between the baler <b>10</b> and the bale wrapper <b>14</b> is not critical, the angle &#x3b1; between the plane <b>46</b> defined by the open mouth <b>45</b> and the vertical plane <b>47</b> may be reduced to zero, or indeed to &#x2212;15&#xb0;, whereby the negative values of the angle &#x3b1; indicate the plane <b>46</b> defined by the open mouth <b>45</b> inclining upwardly in a generally rearwardly direction to the vertical plane <b>47</b>. It is also envisaged in certain cases that the angle &#x3b1; between the plane <b>46</b> defined by the open mouth <b>45</b> and the vertical plane <b>47</b> may lie between +30&#xb0; and &#x2212;30&#xb0;.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Turning now to the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, the bale wrapper <b>14</b> comprises a pair of spaced apart parallel first and second rotatably mounted bale support rollers, namely, a first bale support roller <b>50</b>, and a second bale support roller <b>51</b>, which are rotatable about respective parallel spaced apart first and second rotational axes <b>52</b> and <b>53</b>. The first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> extend parallel to the axle <b>7</b> of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> and support the bale <b>2</b> to be wrapped with the longitudinally extending main central geometrical axis <b>48</b> of the bale <b>2</b> extending parallel to the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>. The first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> are driven by a first drive means, namely, a pair of synchronised first hydraulically powered rotary motors <b>55</b> through a suitable chain drive transmission (not shown) for rotating each bale <b>2</b> about a first wrapping axis <b>56</b> which coincides with the longitudinally extending main central geometrical axis <b>48</b> of the bale <b>2</b> during wrapping of the bale <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A carrier means comprising a substantially vertically extending circular carrier ring <b>58</b> is rotatably mounted on a support frame <b>59</b> extending upwardly from the chassis <b>5</b>, and carries a pair of wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> located at 180&#xb0; intervals around the carrier ring <b>58</b>. The wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> are rigidly mounted on the carrier ring <b>58</b> so that as the carrier ring <b>58</b> rotates, the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> are revolved through a locus of travel around a second wrapping axis <b>61</b> for dispensing the wrapping film <b>3</b> from the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> onto a bale <b>2</b> being rotated on the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> about the first wrapping axis <b>56</b>.

The support frame <b>59</b> and the double flanged drive and idler rollers <b>63</b> and <b>65</b> are configured relative to the chassis <b>5</b> so that the carrier ring <b>58</b> extends substantially transversely of the normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the carrier plane <b>57</b> defined by the carrier ring <b>58</b> extends substantially transversely of the normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> with the second wrapping axis <b>61</b> extending substantially horizontally and perpendicularly relative to the first wrapping axis <b>56</b>. In other words, the second wrapping axis <b>61</b> extends in a general longitudinal direction relative to the normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b>. In this embodiment of the invention the carrier ring <b>58</b> and in turn the carrier plane <b>57</b> are located between the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> and are located closer to the first bale support roller <b>50</b> than to the second bale support roller <b>51</b> for a reason to be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A second drive means, namely, a pair of synchronised second hydraulically powered rotary motors <b>66</b> mounted on the support frame <b>59</b> drive the double flanged drive rollers <b>63</b> for in turn rotating the carrier ring <b>58</b> in order to revolve the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> along the locus of travel which is substantially defined by the carrier ring <b>58</b> around the second wrapping axis <b>61</b>, and in turn around the bale <b>2</b> as the bale <b>2</b> is being rotated about the first wrapping axis <b>56</b> by the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">A first urging means comprising a pair of first double-acting hydraulic ram <b>75</b> acting between respective brackets <b>76</b> on the side members <b>74</b> of the chassis <b>5</b> and brackets <b>77</b> on the side members <b>68</b> of the transfer element <b>16</b> urge the transfer element <b>16</b> about the transfer pivot axis <b>17</b> in the direction of the arrow D from the first state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 11</figref> to the second state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 13</figref> for transferring a formed bale <b>2</b> discharged from the baler <b>10</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Since the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is located on the transfer element <b>16</b> to the side of the transfer pivot axis <b>17</b> which is opposite to the side of the transverse pivot axis <b>17</b> on which the three carrier members <b>70</b> are located, as the transfer element <b>16</b> is being pivoted from the first state to the second state with the carrier members being urged generally upwardly for transferring a bale <b>2</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is urged in a generally downwardly direction in the direction of the arrow F from a bale wrapping state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>11</b> to a downwardly displaced state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This significantly reduces the headroom required by the bale <b>2</b> during transfer of the bale <b>2</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>. In other words, the headroom available to the bale <b>2</b> during transfer of the bale <b>2</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, which is restricted by the carrier ring <b>58</b>, is increased. By increasing the headroom available to the bale during transfer of the bale onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b> by urging the first bale support roller <b>50</b> downwardly into the downwardly displaced state, increased headroom is available to the bale without having to alter the diameter of the carrier ring <b>58</b>. This, thus, allows the diameter of the carrier ring <b>58</b> to be minimised, which in turn reduces the overall width of the combined baler/bale wrapper. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is urged downwardly from the bale wrapping state as the transfer element <b>16</b> is being pivoted from the first state to the second state allows the transfer element <b>16</b> to be located in the first state at a significantly lower level relative to the baler <b>14</b>, than could otherwise be achieved, and still transfer the bale onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>. This in turn allows the baler <b>10</b> to be located on the chassis <b>5</b> at a lower level than could otherwise be achieved, while still allowing discharged of a bale from the baler <b>10</b> onto the transfer element <b>16</b> in the first state. This is a particular advantage when the combined baler/bale wrapper comprises a rear door baler.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Once the bale <b>2</b> has been transferred onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, the transfer element <b>16</b> is returned in the direction of the arrow E by the first hydraulic rams <b>75</b> from the second state to the first state, thereby returning the first bale support roller <b>50</b> to the bale wrapping state with the bale <b>2</b> supported on the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> ready for wrapping, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In this embodiment of the invention the carrier frame <b>80</b> is pivotal about the common pivot mounting axis <b>86</b> for urging the second bale support roller <b>51</b> through the selectable ones of the bale wrapping states from a lower level with the level of the second wrapping axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> at a maximum distance d<sub>2 </sub>of 100 mm below the horizontal axis containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> when the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is in the bale wrapping state, to an upper level with the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> at a maximum distance d<sub>1 </sub>of 100 mm above the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> when the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is in the bale wrapping state.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">However, it is envisaged that in certain cases the carrier frame <b>80</b> may be pivotal about the common pivot mounting axis <b>86</b> for urging the second bale support roller <b>51</b> between the lower level with the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> at a maximum distance d<sub>2 </sub>of 200 mm below the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> when the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is in the bale wrapping state, and an upper level with the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> at a maximum distance d<sub>1 </sub>of 200 mm above the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> with the first bale support roller <b>50</b> in the bale wrapping state, although, in general, it is envisaged that the maximum value of the distance d<b>2</b> would not exceed 300 mm and the maximum value of the distance d<b>1</b> would not exceed 300 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is selected so that the headroom available to the bales during wrapping is maximised. In the case of bales is of relatively small diameter, the bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is selected so that the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is at a level above the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b>. For the bales of the smallest diameter for which the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> is configured to produce, the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is set with the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> at the maximum level d<sub>1 </sub>above the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b>. As the diameter of the bales produced by the baler <b>10</b> increases, the bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is selected so that the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> above the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is reduced. As the diameter of the bales produced by the baler <b>10</b> increases further, the bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is selected so that the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is located at a level below the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b>, and the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> below the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is further increased as the diameter of the bales <b>2</b> increases further. Thus, the headroom available to the bale, which is restricted by the locus of travel of the wrapping film dispenser <b>60</b> is maximised during wrapping of the bale.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">By configuring the second bale support roller <b>51</b> to be operable in a plurality of selectable bale wrapping states for accommodating bales <b>2</b> of different diameters, the headroom available to the bales <b>2</b> during wrapping thereof which is restricted by both the carrier ring <b>58</b> and the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> as the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> pass between the carrier ring <b>58</b> and the rotating bale <b>2</b> above the rotating bale is maximised without the need to increase the diameter of the carrier ring <b>58</b>, and thus the overall width of the combined baler/bale wrapper is minimised.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The horizontal spacing between the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> for all wrapping states of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is greater than the width of the wrapping film <b>3</b> in order to accommodate the wrapping film as it is being dispensed from the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> onto the bale <b>2</b> as the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> pass beneath the rotating bale <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The carrier frame <b>80</b> is also pivotal about the common pivot mounting axis <b>86</b> in the direction of the arrows G and H between each and every one of the selectable bale wrapping states and a discharge state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> for discharging a wrapped bale from the bale wrapper <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As discussed above, the carrier ring <b>58</b> is located closer to the first bale support roller <b>50</b> than to the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in order that the lower portion of the carrier ring <b>58</b> does not impede discharge of a wrapped bale from the bale wrapper <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A second urging means comprising a pair of second double-acting hydraulic rams <b>88</b> acting between the respective mounting plates <b>84</b> at locations <b>89</b> and brackets <b>90</b> mounted on the side members <b>82</b> of the carrier frame <b>80</b> pivots the carrier frame <b>80</b> about the common pivot mounting axis <b>86</b> for setting and retaining the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in a selected one of the selectable bale wrapping states in response to the diameter of the bale produced by the baler <b>10</b>, and also operates the carrier frame <b>80</b> between the selected bale wrapping state and the discharge state for discharging a wrapped bale from the bale wrapper <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Referring now in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a control means, namely, a control circuit <b>92</b> will now be described for controlling the operation of the combined baler/bale wrapper for producing a wrapped bale <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The control circuit <b>92</b> comprises a signal processor, namely, a microcontroller <b>93</b>. An input means, which may be a keypad in conjunction with an liquid crystal display screen, or may be a touch-screen, and in this embodiment of the invention comprises a keypad <b>94</b> and a liquid crystal display screen <b>95</b>, are mounted on the baler <b>10</b> and communicate with the microcontroller <b>93</b> for facilitating inputting of various commands to the microcontroller <b>93</b> for operating the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b>, and also for inputting a selected diameter to which the bale <b>2</b> is to be formed by the baler <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A first monitoring means for monitoring a characteristic of the baler <b>10</b> for determining the diameter of the bale as the bale is being formed in the baler <b>10</b>, in this embodiment of the invention comprises a first rotary potentiometer <b>96</b> which is mounted on the pivot shaft <b>25</b> for detecting the angular movement of the tensioning arms <b>37</b> of the baler <b>10</b> from their initial rest position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> prior to commencement of forming of a bale in the baler <b>10</b>. By detecting the angular position of the tensioning arms <b>37</b> relative to their rest position, the diameter of the bale can be determined, since the diameter of the bale is proportional to the angular displacement of the tensioning arms <b>37</b> from their rest position. Signals from the first rotary potentiometer <b>96</b> are read by the microcontroller <b>93</b>, which in turn computes the current diameter of the bale <b>2</b> as the bale is being formed by the baler <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">A second monitoring means for monitoring the angular position of the carrier frame <b>80</b> relative to the mounting plates <b>84</b>, and in turn for monitoring the current bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> comprises a second rotary potentiometer <b>97</b> mounted on one of the pivot shafts <b>85</b> for monitoring the angular displacement of the carrier frame <b>80</b> relative to the mounting plates <b>84</b>, and in turn the current bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b>. By knowing the angular displacement of the carrier frame <b>80</b> relative to the mounting plates <b>84</b>, the level of the second rotational axis <b>53</b> of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> above or below the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis <b>52</b> of the first bale support roller <b>50</b> can be readily computed. The microcontroller <b>93</b> reads signals from the second rotary potentiometer <b>97</b> and computes the current bale wrapping state of the second bale support roller <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">An hydraulic control circuit <b>98</b> is operated under the control of the microcontroller <b>93</b> for controlling the operation of the main hydraulic rams <b>27</b> for pivoting the rear door <b>20</b> of the baler <b>10</b> in the direction of the arrows A and B between the closed state and the open state, respectively. The hydraulic circuit <b>98</b> also controls the operation of the first hydraulic rams <b>75</b> for pivoting the transfer element <b>16</b> in the direction of the arrows D and E between the first and second states thereof. Additionally, the hydraulic circuit <b>98</b> controls the operation of the second hydraulic rams <b>88</b> for pivoting the carrier frame <b>80</b> in the directions of the arrows G and H for urging the second bale support roller <b>51</b> into a selected one of the selectable bale wrapping states, and also for pivoting the carrier frame <b>80</b> between the selected one of the bale wrapping states and the discharge state. Solenoid controlled hydraulic valves <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> operating under the control of the microcontroller <b>93</b> control the supply of hydraulic fluid from a pressurised hydraulic fluid source <b>103</b> to the main hydraulic rams <b>27</b>, the first hydraulic rams <b>75</b> and the second hydraulic rams <b>88</b>, respectively, for appropriately operating the main hydraulic rams <b>27</b> and the first and second hydraulic rams <b>75</b> and <b>88</b> under the control of the microcontroller <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">A look-up table is stored in the microcontroller <b>93</b> with diameters of bales cross-referenced with appropriate bale wrapping states of the second bale support roller <b>51</b>. The microcontroller <b>93</b> is programmed to read the appropriate bale wrapping state for the second bale support roller <b>51</b> from the look-up table corresponding to the selected diameter of the bale <b>2</b>, in response to the selected diameter of the bale <b>2</b> being inputted through the key pad <b>94</b>. The microcontroller <b>93</b> operates the solenoid valve <b>102</b> to in turn operate the second hydraulic rams <b>88</b> to set the carrier frame <b>80</b> for in turn setting the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in the appropriate bale wrapping state. The microcontroller <b>93</b> continuously reads signals from the second rotary potentiometer <b>97</b> during setting of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in the appropriate bale wrapping state to determine when the second bale support roller <b>51</b> is in the appropriate bale wrapping state. The microcontroller <b>93</b> also continuously reads signals from the second rotary potentiometer <b>97</b> during wrapping of the bale <b>2</b> and operates the solenoid controlled hydraulic valve <b>102</b> for in turn operating the second hydraulic rams <b>88</b> for maintaining the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in the appropriate bale wrapping state in response to the signals received from the second rotary potentiometer <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The first and second hydraulically powered rotary motors <b>55</b> and <b>66</b> are connected in series in order to synchronise the speeds of the first and second motors <b>55</b> and <b>66</b>. Hydraulic fluid is supplied to the first and second motors <b>55</b> and <b>66</b> from the pressurised hydraulic fluid source <b>103</b> through a variable flow control valve <b>104</b> under the control of the microcontroller <b>93</b> for controlling the speed of the first and second hydraulic motors <b>55</b> and <b>66</b> for in turn controlling the rotational speeds of the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> and the carrier ring <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In use, with the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> hitched to a towing vehicle, such as, for example, a tractor, and with the power take-off shaft of the tractor coupled to the drive transmission (not shown) of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> for rotating the driven rollers <b>30</b> to drive the belts <b>29</b>, the bale rotating rollers <b>40</b> and for operating the pick-up mechanism <b>43</b>, as well for powering the pressurised hydraulic fluid source <b>103</b> of the hydraulic circuit <b>98</b>, the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> is ready for use. The desired diameter to which the bales <b>2</b> are to be formed by the baler <b>10</b> is selected and inputted to the microcontroller <b>93</b> through the keypad <b>94</b>. Other selectable control parameters of the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> which will be well known to those skilled in the art are also inputted to the microcontroller <b>93</b> through the keypad <b>94</b>. With the rear door <b>20</b> of the baler <b>10</b> in the closed state ad with the transfer element <b>16</b> in the first state, the combined baler/bale wrapper <b>1</b> is then towed by the towing vehicle along a sward of cut grass, hay, straw or other forage material to be baled with the pick-up mechanism <b>43</b> picking up the forage material from the sward and delivering the forage material to the baler <b>10</b> through the bale rotating rollers <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As the forage material is urged by the pick-up mechanism <b>43</b> through the bale rotating rollers <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b, </i>the belts <b>29</b> are urged away from the bale rotating rollers <b>40</b> to commence the formation of the forage material into a bale with the bale rotating rollers <b>40</b> and the belts <b>29</b> forming the bale forming chamber <b>42</b>. The action of the bale rotating rollers <b>40</b> which are rotated in the direction of the arrow K and the belts <b>29</b> which are urged by the driven rollers <b>30</b> in the direction of the arrow L commence rotation of the forage material in the bale forming chamber <b>42</b> in the direction of the arrow N, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which in turn commences the formation of the cylindrical bale <b>2</b>. As more forage material is urged by the pick-up mechanism <b>43</b> into the bale forming chamber <b>42</b>, the tensioning arms <b>37</b> pivot in the direction of the arrow P to pay out the slack in the belts <b>29</b>, which had been taken up in the belts <b>29</b> by the tensioning rollers <b>32</b>, in order to accommodate the increasing diameter of the bale being formed. The tensioning springs <b>36</b> which act on the tensioning arms <b>37</b> ensure that the bale is formed to an appropriate degree of compactness.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The microcontroller <b>93</b> reads signals from the first rotary potentiometer <b>96</b> as the bale <b>2</b> is being formed by the baler <b>10</b>, and on detecting the bale <b>2</b> having been formed to the selected diameter, the microcontroller <b>93</b> operates a circumferential wrapping system (not illustrated) to circumferentially wrap the formed bale in the bale forming chamber <b>42</b> of the baler <b>10</b>. The circumferential wrapping of a bale in a bale forming chamber of a baler will be well known to those skilled in the art. On completion of circumferential wrapping of the bale, the microcontroller <b>93</b> operates the main rams <b>27</b> for pivoting the rear door <b>20</b> of the baler <b>10</b> in the direction of the arrow A from the closed state to the open state. As the rear door <b>20</b> is being pivoted from the closed to the open state and with the transfer element <b>16</b> in the first state, the formed bale is discharged onto the carrier members <b>70</b> of the transfer element <b>16</b> with the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis <b>48</b> of the bale <b>2</b> extending parallel to the transfer pivot axis <b>17</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. With the rear door <b>20</b> in the open state, the microcontroller <b>93</b> operates the first rams <b>75</b> to pivot the transfer element <b>16</b> about the transfer pivot axis <b>17</b> in the direction of the arrow D from the first state to the second state for transferring the bale <b>2</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b> with the longitudinally extending main central geometrical axis <b>48</b> of the bale <b>2</b> extending parallel to the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. As the transfer element <b>16</b> is being urged about the transfer pivot axis <b>17</b> by the first hydraulic rams <b>75</b> from the first state to the second state, the first bale support roller <b>50</b> is displaced in a generally downwardly direction in the direction of the arrow F, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, thereby maximising the headroom between the first bale support roller <b>50</b> and the carrier ring <b>58</b> during transfer of the bale <b>2</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b> over the first bale support roller <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As the transfer element <b>16</b> is being urged by the first hydraulic rams <b>75</b> about the transfer pivot axis <b>17</b> in the direction of the arrow D from the first state to the second state, the bale <b>2</b> rolls downwardly onto the first bale support roller <b>50</b> where it is supported on the first bale support roller <b>50</b> and two of the carrier members <b>70</b> of the transfer element <b>16</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Further pivoting of the transfer element <b>16</b> in the direction of the arrow D results in the bale being supported by both the first and the second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, with the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in the appropriate one of the bale wrapping states and the first bale support roller <b>50</b> in the downwardly displaced position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Once the transfer element <b>16</b> is in the second state with the bale <b>2</b> supported on the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, the microcontroller <b>93</b> operates the first rams <b>75</b> to return the transfer element <b>16</b> in the direction of the arrow E from the second state to the first state for in turn returning the first bale support roller <b>50</b> upwardly to the bale wrapping state, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Additionally, once the transfer element <b>16</b> has been returned to the first state, the microcontroller <b>93</b> operates the main rams <b>27</b> for pivoting the rear door <b>20</b> in the direction of the arrow B from the open state to the closed state ready for commencement of formation of the next bale to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">While the transfer element <b>16</b> is transferring the bale <b>2</b> onto the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, if the second bale support roller <b>51</b> has not already been set in the appropriate bale wrapping state corresponding to the diameter of the formed bale <b>2</b> by the second hydraulic rams <b>88</b>, the microcontroller <b>93</b> from the look-up table determines the appropriate bale wrapping state for the second bale support roller <b>51</b> which corresponds to the selected diameter to which the bale <b>2</b> has been formed, and the microprocessor <b>93</b> then operates the second hydraulic rams <b>88</b> to pivot the carrier frame <b>80</b> about the common pivot mounting axis <b>86</b> for in turn setting the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in the appropriate bale wrapping state. With the second bale support roller <b>51</b> set in the appropriate bale wrapping state, the bale <b>2</b> is supported on the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> with sufficient headroom to accommodate the passage of the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> over the bale <b>2</b> supported on the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> during wrapping of the bale <b>2</b>. During setting of the second bale support roller <b>51</b> in the appropriate bale wrapping state, the microcontroller <b>93</b> reads signals from the second rotary potentiometer <b>97</b> in order to determine when the angular position of the carrier frame <b>80</b> relative to the mounting plates <b>84</b> is at the angle which corresponds to the appropriate bale wrapping state.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">With the bale supported on the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>, the microcontroller <b>93</b> operates the first and second hydraulic motors <b>55</b> and <b>66</b> for rotating the first and second bale support rollers <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> and for rotating the carrier ring <b>58</b>, for in turn rotating the bale <b>2</b> about the first wrapping axis <b>56</b>, and for revolving the film dispensers <b>60</b> about the second wrapping axis <b>61</b>. As the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> are being revolved about the second wrapping axis <b>61</b>, the wrapping film <b>3</b> is dispensed from the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b> and wrapped onto the rotating bale <b>2</b> with overlapping turns of the wrapping film <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">On completion of wrapping of the bale <b>2</b> with the wrapping film <b>3</b>, cut-and-hold mechanisms (not shown) are operated under the control of the microcontroller <b>93</b> to sever the wrapping film <b>3</b> which has been wrapped onto the bale <b>2</b> from the wrapping film in the wrapping film dispensers <b>60</b>. The microcontroller <b>93</b> then operates the second rams <b>88</b> to pivot the carrier frame <b>80</b> in the direction of the arrow G into the discharge state for discharging the wrapped bale <b>2</b> from the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">On discharge of the wrapped bale <b>2</b> from the bale wrapper <b>14</b>, the microprocessor <b>93</b> operates the second rams <b>88</b> to return the mounting element <b>80</b> and in turn the second bale support roller <b>51</b> to the appropriate one of the bale wrapping states, so that the bale wrapper <b>14</b> is ready to receive and wrap the next bale from the baler <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">While the bale wrapper according to the invention with the transfer element has been described as being mounted on a combined baler/bale wrapper, it is envisaged that the bale wrapper according to the invention with the transfer element may be provided as a bale wrapper in its own right without being mounted on a combined baler/bale wrapper or attached to a baler. In which case, the bale wrapper may be adapted so that the transfer element would be configured to pick up a bale from the ground and transfer the bale onto the bale wrapper, or alternatively, the transfer element may be adapted for receiving a bale placed thereon by another device, for example, a bale handler, or being dropped from a baler independently of the bale wrapper for transfer of the bale onto the bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">It is also envisaged that the bale wrapper according to the invention, whether provided on its own or in conjunction with a baler in the form of a combined baler/bale wrapper, may be provided with the transfer element, but with the second bale support roller being adapted to operate in one bale wrapping state only. It is envisaged in the case of this bale wrapper according to the invention that while the second bale support roller is only operable in one single bale wrapping state, the second bale support roller would be mounted on a mounting element, carrier frame or other suitable mounting arrangement which would permit lowering of the second bale support roller in order to facilitate discharge of a bale from the bale wrapper. In cases where the bale wrapper according to the invention is provided in conjunction with a baler in the form of a combined baler/bale wrapper, and where the second bale support roller is operable in only one single bale wrapping state, it is envisaged that the baler may be configured to produce bales of one diameter only, or the baler may be configured to permit bales of selectable diameters to be formed, whereby the diameters of the bales would be such as to be accommodated by the available headroom of the bale wrapper during wrapping of the bale.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Further, it is envisaged that the bale wrapper according to the invention with the second bale support roller operable in the plurality of second bale wrapping state, whether provided on its own or in conjunction with a baler in the form of a combined baler/bale wrapper, may be provided without the transfer element. In which case, where this bale wrapper according to the invention is provided in conjunction with a baler in the form of a combined baler/bale wrapper, any other suitable transfer means for transferring the bale from the baler to the bale wrapper may be provided, and in certain cases, it is envisaged that the baler and this bale wrapper according to the invention may be located relative to each other so that the bale is discharged from the baler directly onto the bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">While the bale wrapper has been described as comprising a pair of wrapping film dispensers mounted on a carrier ring, in certain cases, it is envisaged that a single wrapping film dispenser may be provided, and indeed in other cases more than two wrapping film dispensers may be provided. It is also envisaged that instead of the wrapping film dispensers being rigidly secured to the carrier ring, it is envisaged that the wrapping film dispenser or dispensers may be mounted on the carrier ring such that the carrier ring would be fixed but would guide the wrapping film dispenser or dispensers around the second wrapping axis. In which case, a suitable transmission means would be provided for driving the wrapping film dispenser or dispensers around the carrier ring.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It will also be appreciated that the second wrapping axis instead of being horizontal may extend at an angle to the horizontal, in which case the carrier ring or other such carrier element or carrier means which either carry or guide the wrapping film dispenser or dispensers around the second wrapping axis would define a carrier plane which would extend at a corresponding angle to a vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">While the carrier means has been described as comprising a carrier ring of circular shape, the carrier ring may be of any other suitable or desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">It is also envisaged that the baler may be of any other suitable or desirable construction besides being a belt baler. For example, it is envisaged that the baler may be of the type which is commonly referred to as a fixed chamber baler whereby the bale forming chamber is defined by a plurality of parallel bale rotating rollers which define the circumferential periphery of the bale forming chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">While the transfer means has been described as comprising a transfer element of a particular shape and construction, any other suitable transfer means may be provided. It will also be appreciated that any other suitable receiving means besides the carrier members may be provided on the transfer element for receiving a formed bale for transfer to the bale wrapper. Where the receiving means is provided by carrier members, it is envisaged that the carrier members may comprise rotatable carrier rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">While the means for setting the second bale support roller in the selectable bale wrapping states has been described as comprising the combination of the pivotally mounted carrier frame and the second hydraulic rams for pivoting the carrier frame about the pivot mounting axis, for in turn raising and lowering the second bale support roller relative to the first bale support roller when the first bale support roller is in the bale wrapping state, it is envisaged in certain cases that the second bale support roller may be urged laterally with rectilinear motion towards and away from the first bale support roller into the respective selectable bale wrapping states. In which case, the spacing between the first and second bale support rollers would be altered for setting the second bale support roller in the respective selectable bale wrapping states. This would also permit the level at which the bale is supported on the first and second bale support rollers to be varied, in order to vary the headroom available to the bale during wrapping thereof. Where the second bale support roller is laterally moveable relative to the first bale support roller with rectilinear motion, it is envisaged that the second bale support roller may be mounted on a telescoping element which would facilitate urging of the second bale support roller towards and away from the first bale support roller for selecting the respective ones of the selectable bale wrapping states of the second bale support rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Indeed, it is envisaged that the second bale support roller could be supported on a carrier frame which would comprise a pair of side members, which would be pivotally mounted as already described, and the side members could also be telescoping members or slideably mounted relative to each other. The pivotal movement could be used for operating the second bale support roller between the bale wrapping state and the discharge state, while the slideable movement of the side members could be used for adjusting the spacing between the first and second bale support rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">It is also envisaged that the second bale support roller may only be urged into the bale wrapping state when the bale has been transferred by the transfer element onto the first and second bale support rollers. However, the second bale support roller would be maintained in the appropriate bale wrapping state during wrapping of the bale on the bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">It is also envisaged that the second bale support roller may be operated under certain circumstances to assist in retaining a bale on the bale wrapper during towing of the combined baler/bale wrapper by the tractor or other towing vehicle. For example, in a case, when the combined baler/bale wrapper is being towed up a hill or an upward incline, the second bale support roller would be urged upwardly to the maximum level above the level of the first bale support roller, in other words, to the maximum level at which the second bale support roller could be set above the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis of the first bale support roller when the combined baler/bale wrapper is on horizontal ground. This would act to prevent the bale rolling backwardly off the bale wrapper as the combined baler/bale wrapper is being towed up a hill or an upward incline. On the other hand, in cases where the combined baler/bale wrapper is being towed downwardly down a hill or other such downward incline, it is envisaged that the second bale support roller would be located at the lowest level at which the second bale support roller could be supported below the level of the horizontal plane containing the first rotational axis of the first bale support roller when the combined baler/bale wrapper is on level ground. In which case, it is envisaged that the combined baler/bale wrapper may be provided with a tilt switch for detecting the angle of the combined baler/bale wrapper relative to the horizontal, and the second ram would be operable in response to signals from the tilt switch indicating that the combined baler/bale wrapper is being towed upwardly up an upward incline or downwardly down a downward incline for appropriately raising or lowering the second bale support roller.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">While the microcontroller has been described as continuously monitoring signals from the second rotary potentiometer during wrapping of the bale in the bale wrapper and for controlling the operation of the second rams for maintaining the second bale support roller in the desired bale wrapping state, it is envisaged that once the second rams have been operated to initially set the second bale support roller in the appropriate bale wrapping state in response to signals read from the second rotary potentiometer, no further reading of the signals from the second rotary potentiometer should be needed during wrapping of the bale, since once the second rams have been set with the second bale support roller in the appropriate bale wrapping state, it is believed that the second rams should be capable of maintaining the second bale support roller in the appropriate bale wrapping state during wrapping of that bale without further monitoring the level of the second bale support roller.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">While the control means has been described as comprising a control circuit comprising a signal processor provided by a microcontroller, any other suitable control circuit, and any other suitable signal processor may be provided. For example, control of the operation of the combined baler/bale wrapper could be carried out by a signal processor provided by a microprocessor, and indeed, in certain cases the signal processor may be provided by a programmable logic controller.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">While the baler and the bale wrapper of the combined baler/bale wrapper have been described for forming a bale of forage material and wrapping the bale, both the baler and the bale wrapper could be adapted for forming and wrapping bales of any type of material, be it forage material such as grass, hay, straw, silage and the like, or any other material, be it agricultural waste material or indeed industrial waste material or any other material.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Further, it is envisaged that the bale wrapper may be adapted for wrapping bales of cotton and other such materials.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">While the first and second urging means have been described as being provided by pairs of first and second hydraulic rams, it is envisaged in certain cases that single first and second hydraulic rams may be provided. Indeed, it will also be appreciated that any other suitable first and second urging means besides rams may be provided. For example, linear motors, be they hydraulic linear motors or electrical linear motors, solenoids or the like may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">While the carrier plane defined by the carrier ring has been described as extending substantially vertically and transversely of the combined baler/bale wrapper, it will be appreciated that it is not necessary that the carrier plane defined by the carrier ring should extend vertically. The carrier plane defined by the carrier ring may extend at any suitable or desirable angle to the vertical plane. Indeed, in certain cases, it is envisaged that the carrier plane defined by the carrier ring may extend at an angle of up to plus or minus 30&#xb0; to the vertical plane, plus 30&#xb0; being indicative of an upwardly forward inclination of the carrier frame at 30&#xb0; relative to the vertical plane, and minus 30&#xb0; being indicative of an upwardly rearwardly inclination of the carrier plane at 30&#xb0; relative to the vertical plane</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Indeed, in other cases, it is envisaged that the carrier ring may extend relative to the horizontal at an angle of up to 30&#xb0; to the horizontal. In which case, the advantage of the bale wrapper according to the invention whereby the second bale support roller is operable in a plurality of selectable bale wrapping states would allow bales of different diameters to be supported on the first and second bale support rollers with the level of the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis of the bales maintained at a substantially constant level, or within a relatively narrow range of levels irrespective of the diameter of the bale. This would allow the wrapping film to be applied to the rotating bale with a longitudinally extending centre line of the wrapping film substantially coinciding with the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis of the bale irrespective of the diameter of the bale within reason, which is desirable during wrapping of a cylindrical bale.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">It will also be appreciated that while the open mouth defined by the stationary part of the baler has been described as defining a plane which extends in a generally upwardly forwardly direction relative to the normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper, the open mouth defined by the stationary part of the baler may be inclined in a generally upwardly rearwardly direction relative to the normal forward direction of travel of the combined baler/bale wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">While the moveable one of the first and second bale support rollers which is moveable into a plurality of selectable bale wrapping states has been described as being the second bale support roller, in certain cases, it is envisaged that the moveable one of the first and second bale support rollers which would be moveable into the selectable bale wrapping states could be the first bale support roller. In which case, it is envisaged that the first bale support roller would be mounted on the transfer element where the bale wrapper is provided with a transfer element, and the first bale support roller would be mounted on the transfer element to be moveable relative to the transfer element for in turn moving the first bale support roller relative to the second bale support roller into selectable ones of the plurality of selectable bale wrapping states.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">While the bale wrapper has been described as being a two axis bale wrapper whereby the wrapping film dispensers are revolved around the rotating bale about a second wrapping axis, which extends substantially horizontally, it is envisaged that the bale wrapper may be of the type in which one or more wrapping film dispensers are rotated about a vertically extending second wrapping axis while the bale is being rotated about the first wrapping axis coinciding with the longitudinally extending central geometrical axis of the bale which would extend horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">While the bale wrapper has been described for wrapping a cylindrical bale, it is envisaged that the bale wrapper may be adapted for wrapping a parallelepiped bale, and in which case when provided in a combined baler/bale wrapper, the baler would be a baler of the type for producing a parallelepiped bale.</p>
