<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates, in general, to the field of retaining articles in place and, more particularly, to the a multi-purpose retaining device for retaining materials such as bed sheets, tarps, table cloths, and similar articles in place.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Without limiting the scope of the present disclosure, its background will be described with reference to bed coverings, as an example. Bed coverings and particularly sheets often slip due to loss of elastic, for example. Alternatively, thin, extremely smooth sheets, and flat sheets without an edge may also experience slipping. Sheets that have slipped may lead to discomfort while sleeping and present untidy or careless appearance. Accordingly, a need exists for improvements in the field of retaining articles, such as bed coverings, in place.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be advantageous to achieve advances in the field of retaining articles, such as bed coverings and sheets, which address slipping. It would also be desirable to enable a mechanical solution that would be easy and convenient to use for retaining all types of articles, while promoting a tidy and organized appearance. To better address one or more of these concerns, a multi-purpose retaining device is disclosed. In one embodiment, a cord having two ends is provided that is composed of an elastomeric material configured to deform elastically upon elongation. Each of the ends of the cord is threaded through a cord stop, which permits the length of each end to be adjusted, with any spare cord forming a loop extending from a side of the cord stop opposite the two ends. Suspension clips are respectively slidably connected to each end of the cord in order to grip a material. In one embodiment of a kit, the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device may be employed with a material, such as bed covering to provide a fitted sheet equivalent. These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts, which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, therein is depicted one embodiment of a multi-purpose adjustable retaining device that is schematically illustrated and generally designated <b>10</b>. As shown, the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device <b>10</b> includes a cord <b>12</b>, which has two ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, composed of an elastomeric material configured to deform elastically upon elongation. Each of ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the cord <b>12</b> are threaded through a cord stop <b>18</b>, which permits the length of the cord <b>12</b> to be adjusted, with any spare cord <b>12</b> forming a loop. Suspension clips <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>, which may be individually or collectively suspension clips <b>20</b>, are respectively slidably connected to each end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the cord <b>10</b> in order to grip a material.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As depicted, the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device <b>10</b> is gripping a fitted bed sheet S, which over time and through use has lost its elastic edge E. In this manner, the multipurpose adjustable retaining device forms a portion of a kit providing a fitted sheet equivalent for a bed sheet having a non-elastic edge, for example. It should be appreciated that although the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device <b>10</b> is illustrated being utilized to retain a bed sheet under the desired tension, the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device may be employed to provide increased tension and/or fit to a variety of materials. By way of example and not by way of limitation, the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device may be employed with bed coverings, flat sheets, mattress pads, futons, RV beds, travel trailer beds, camper beds, air mattresses, grill covers, tablecloths, furniture covers, pet bedding covers, outdoor equipment covers, car seat covers, boat seat covers, and message tables, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, as discussed, the cord <b>12</b> includes ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and is composed of an elastomeric material <b>30</b> configured to deform elastically upon elongation. As shown, the elastomeric material <b>30</b> includes an original length L<sub>O </sub>and a length after elongation L<sub>E</sub>, wherein LE is greater than L<sub>O</sub>. In one implementation, the modulus of elasticity of the cord <b>12</b> is as follows, expressed by stretch:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0000">
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>STRETCH=80%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0000">It should be appreciated, however, that the elasticity as expressed or represented by stretch of the cord <b>12</b> may be between about 65% and about 95%. Further, in one implementation, other characteristics of the cord <b>12</b> may include about &#x215b;&#x2033; diameter cord (+/&#x2212;0.050&#x2033;), including about 30% (+/&#x2212;4%) nylon yarn and about 70% (+/&#x2212;4%) natural rubber with a machine size of about 16 CARR.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0022">The cord stop <b>18</b> divides the cord <b>12</b> into a cord segment <b>32</b> proximate the end <b>14</b>, a cord segment <b>34</b> proximate the end <b>16</b> and a loop segment <b>36</b>. As shown, the initial length L<sub>1-O </sub>of the cord segment <b>32</b> is between about 0 (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) and about the original length L<sub>0 </sub>(e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) of the cord <b>12</b>. Similarly, the initial length L<sub>2-O </sub>of the cord segment <b>34</b> is between about 0 (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and about the original length L<sub>0 </sub>(e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). The loop length L<sub>L-O </sub>of the loop segment is between about 0 (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) and about the original length L<sub>0 </sub>of the cord <b>12</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). As shown, the sum of the initial length L<sub>1-0 </sub>of the cord segment <b>32</b>, the initial length L<sub>2-0 </sub>of the cord segment <b>34</b>, and the loop length L<sub>L-0 </sub>is equal to the original length L<sub>O </sub>of the cord <b>12</b>. Moreover, the lengths of the cord segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0023">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 4B</figref>, each of the cord segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> as well as the entire cord <b>12</b> has an elongated length. As shown, the cord <b>12</b> has an elongated length L<sub>E</sub>. The cord segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> have respective elongated lengths of L<sub>1-E</sub>, and L<sub>2-E</sub>. As shown by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C for comparative and illustrative purposes, the elongated lengths L<sub>1-E</sub>, and L<sub>2-E </sub>depend on the elasticity, stretch, and the stain of the cord <b>12</b> as well as the lengths L<sub>1-0 </sub>and L<sub>2-0 </sub>of the respective cord segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the cord stop <b>18</b> includes a barrel <b>44</b> having a floor member <b>46</b> with a sidewall <b>48</b> extending therefrom. The floor member <b>46</b> includes an interior <b>50</b> and an exterior <b>52</b>. An opening <b>54</b> is defined by the sidewall <b>48</b>. A flange <b>56</b> circumscribes the sidewall <b>48</b> and extends inward therefrom into the opening <b>54</b>. Two pairs of aligned openings <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> traverse the sidewall <b>48</b>. A plunger <b>66</b> is spring-mounted to the interior <b>50</b> of the barrel <b>44</b> such that the plunger is biased against the floor member <b>46</b>. As shown, in one embodiment, the plunger <b>66</b> includes two channels <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> passing therethrough. A spring <b>72</b> is mounted, in an interposing manner, in between the interior <b>50</b> of the barrel <b>44</b> and the plunger <b>66</b>. As shown by arrow <b>74</b>, the spring <b>72</b> presses the plunger <b>66</b> toward the opening <b>54</b> and the flange <b>56</b>, which restricts the movement of the plunger <b>66</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the channels <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> are aligned with the pairs of aligned openings <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the cord stop <b>18</b> when the spring-mounted plunger <b>66</b> is compressed. On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> by arrow <b>76</b>, the channels <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> are vertically offset from the pairs of aligned openings <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the cord stop <b>18</b> when the spring-mounted plunger <b>66</b> is relaxed. Further, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the cord <b>12</b> are threaded through the pairs of aligned openings <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the cord stop <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, crimping loop sleeves <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are coupled to the respective ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the cord <b>12</b> by being secured to respective end loops <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> at the ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. As shown, the suspension clips <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>, which in one embodiment, may be metal suspension clips, are respectively slidably secured to the end loops <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> as shown by arrows <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>. Each of the suspension clips <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> includes a base member <b>100</b> having teeth <b>102</b>. A slotted flange member <b>104</b> having a slot <b>106</b> extends from the base member <b>100</b>. Further, a pair of opposing flange members <b>108</b> also extend from the base member <b>100</b>. As illustrated, a gripping member <b>110</b> with teeth <b>112</b> is provided. In one embodiment, the teeth <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> include plastic inserts configured to provide a plastic-to-plastic grip therebetween.

<p id="p-0029" num="0026">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>, in operation, the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device <b>10</b> provides a thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b> and a handle area <b>132</b> for the two-handed selective adjustment of the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device <b>10</b>. Initially, the suspension clips <b>20</b> are coupled to the material, which is depicted as a fitted bed sheet S that has lost the elasticity of elastic edge E. With respect to the thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b>, the exterior <b>52</b> of the floor member <b>46</b> of the barrel <b>44</b> of the cord stop <b>18</b> is sized to provide a finger platform component <b>134</b> of a thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b>. Cooperating therewith, as shown, the plunger <b>66</b> is sized to provide a thumb platform component <b>136</b> of the thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, the thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b> is configured to furnish a subtermino-lateral opposition key grip wherein the pad of the thumb presses against the side of the index finger to hold the cord stop therebetween. Alternatively, the thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b> is configured to provide a subterminal opposition in which the palmar surfaces of the thumb and index finger to hold the cord stop therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0027">With the individual engaging the thumb-finger precision grip platform with the thumb T and index finger F, the other hand H grasps the loop segment <b>36</b> of the cord <b>12</b> in preparation to adjust the length of the cord segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and loop segment <b>36</b>, and the tension of the loop segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The plunger <b>66</b> is depressed by the index finger F, permitting the cord <b>12</b> to be selectively and adjustably engaged by the hand H until the desired length of loop segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and tension is realized. As previously discussed, each loop segment <b>34</b>, <b>34</b> of the cord <b>12</b> may be of a different length or the same length, depending on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0028">With respect to the handle area <b>132</b> for the two-handed selective adjustment, a hand may manipulate the length and thereby, the tension, of the cord segments. That is, the thumb-finger precision grip platform <b>130</b> cooperates with the loop segment <b>36</b> at the handle area <b>132</b> to provide one-hand selective actuation of the multi-purpose adjustable retaining device <b>10</b> and, simultaneously, other-hand adjustment of the length of the cord segments <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. As discussed, the cord segments are configured to deform elastically upon elongation responsive to the suspension clips being coupled to a material.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0029">It should be appreciated that although particular cords, cord stops and suspension clips are depicted in the drawings, other types of cord stops and suspension clips are within the teachings presented herein. By way of example and not by way of limitation, the cord may be a bungee cord with a circular cross-section or generally any type of elastic band. Other materials that may be utilized include nylon, plastic, rubber, string, or any other material. The cord may be one or two cords of various lengths, diameters or measurements. As discussed, the cord may include some elasticity, but in some applications a fixed cord length may be desirable and, in those instances, a non-elastic cord may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0030">The cord stop may be a cord lock of the type defining at least one passage therethrough and adapted to releasably engage a cord by operation of a spring-loaded release button. Cord stops may be obtained in many configurations, some of which have a button-like appearance, and others which have a barrel shape. Similarly, cord stops may include multiple passages therethrough to receive two or more cords. By way of further example, the suspension clips may be a clamp, clasp, clip, hook or loop fastener, button, magnet, or pin, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0031">The order of execution or performance of the methodologies illustrated and described herein is not essential, unless otherwise specified. That is, elements of the methods may be performed in any order, unless otherwise specified, and that the methods may include more or less elements than those disclosed herein. For example, it is contemplated that executing or performing a particular element before, contemporaneously with, or after another element are all possible sequences of execution.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/886,308, filed Oct. 3, 2013 under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present device generally relates to support devices, and particularly support devices. More specifically, the device relates to a customizable therapeutic support device used for sleeping or exercises, also known in the industry as a &#x201c;roll pillow.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Physical therapy is a well-established branch of medicine and has developed as a useful means for helping people with specific physical issues function at a higher level. A physical therapist works with a patient using specifically prescribed exercises to, among other things, improve range of motion, reduce pain and swelling, and strengthen muscles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, during such exercises or sleeping, it is important to properly support certain areas of the patient's appendages. To achieve the proper support, the therapist utilizes numerous pillows, pads, and the like. However, when it comes to supporting a patient's body, such as the head and neck, one-sized support certainly does not work for all patients having differently sized body parts. In fact, when it comes to supporting the most vital appendage of the human body, such as the head and neck areas, many factors, such as contour, density and hardness, vary significantly per each patient. This is well-known that the proper support is important during exercise or sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A support device is needed that better facilitates exercise or sleeping by individuals with flexibility and/or medical issues of the type described above. Ideally, an improved support device is inherently stable and decreases the pressure felt by the individual by providing a larger contact area or interface between the device and the individual during exercise or sleeping. It is desirable to have a system, which could be adjusted to fit each individual's unique body and support needs. Such a device and the method for using the device provide therapeutic benefits to patients. Chiropractors, physiatrists, orthopedists and physical therapists would especially find the device and methods to be very useful in patient care. Thus, there is a need for developing an improved therapeutic support device having an enhanced configuration that provides reduced strain and personalized fitting regardless of the individual's unique body and support needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to a support device or a therapeutic custom roll pillow constructed and arranged for providing customizable support on the head and neck areas of a user. The present pillow provides orthopedic support, which is customizable for fitting the user's body, needs, and/or preferences without using differently sized pillows. Specifically, the present pillow provides support for the natural contour of the cervical lordosis, but is customizable to fit different body areas and variations in the sizes and preferences of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, the degeneration of neck curvature occurs more from front to back of the cervical spine than from side to side. The user may sleep or rest on his back and on his side, but the user needs different height supports for back sleeping and side sleeping. For example, the pillow should be lower when sleeping on one's back, and higher when sleeping on the side, because when the user sleeps on the side, the head is positioned higher than when resting on his back. Thus, the user needs a higher head support to maintain the straight spinal alignment depending on an orientation of the user's body, e.g., during sleeping on the side. The present pillow supports the neck curve or the natural contour of the cervical lordosis when lying in the supine position. When the user rests on the side, the present pillow provides a higher support, and appropriately supports the head to maintain the straight alignment of the neck without additional adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described in greater detail below, the present pillow includes a substantially cylindrical body having two parts, preferably interfacing along a longitudinal plane, and the cylindrical body is formed of a material suitable for supporting an area of a body, where each part defines a portion of a cavity within the body. At least one adjustable insert portion is positioned within the cavity of the body, and is movable and adjustable within the cavity to alter the support of the cylindrical body. Accordingly, the present pillow provides a custom fit for the user that enables at least two different height supports with just one pillow. Using the present pillow, the user obtains support for the head and neck areas in various sleeping positions by moving the head to different areas on the pillow during sleeping or exercise.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a support device includes a substantially cylindrical body having a first elongated body portion and a second elongated body portion. Each body portion has a generally semi-cylindrical shape, interfacing along a longitudinal plane. An inner cavity is disposed on an inner surface of each of the first and second body portions, and is dimensioned for receiving at least one removable and adjustable insert, such that each insert is adjustable and positionable for conforming to a profile of a body of a user. The at least one adjustable insert is movable within the cavity for altering the support of the cylindrical body for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a support device includes a substantially cylindrical body having a first elongated body portion and a second elongated body portion. Each body portion has a generally semi-cylindrical shape, interfacing along a longitudinal plane. An inner cavity is disposed on an inner surface of the corresponding body portion, and is dimensioned for receiving at least one removable and adjustable insert, such that each insert is adjustable and positionable for conforming to a profile of a body of a user. The at least one adjustable insert is movable within the cavity for altering the support of the cylindrical body for the user, and the at least one insert has a central opening dimensioned for accommodating insertion of an auxiliary insert.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing and other aspects and features of the disclosure will become apparent to those of reasonable skill in the art from the following detailed description, as considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, an improved support device or a therapeutic custom roll pillow is generally designated <b>10</b>, and the present support device is used and positioned by a user as illustrated for supporting the neck and head areas of a user in the supine or side lying position. During exercise or sleeping, it is important to properly support a cervical lordotic curve and/or a thoracic spine connected to the neck and head areas of the user for comfort and reinforcement. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, an outer surface <b>12</b> of the support device <b>10</b> provides back support on the convexity of the thoracic spine, neck, and head areas of the user. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref>, the outer surface <b>12</b> provides side support on the spine, neck, and head areas of the user. Although the present support device <b>10</b> is shown as supporting the spine, neck, and head areas of the user, it is also contemplated that the device can be used in other areas of the user's body to suit different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the present support device <b>10</b> is shown in an open position. In the preferred embodiment, the present support device <b>10</b> has a first elongated body portion <b>14</b> and a second elongated body portion <b>16</b>. Each body portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> has a generally semi-cylindrical shape, and includes an inner cavity <b>18</b> being disposed on an inner surface <b>20</b> of the corresponding body portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and being dimensioned for receiving at least one removable and adjustable insert <b>22</b>. It is preferred that the inner cavity <b>18</b> has a linear or straight orientation along a central longitudinal axis of the corresponding body portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, such that the cavities <b>18</b> of the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are disposed substantially in parallel with each other when the support device <b>10</b> is in a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Each insert <b>22</b> is adjustable and positionable for conforming to a profile or contour of a cervical spine of the user, or for satisfying the needs or preferences of the user. Although the semi-cylindrical shape is shown for the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and a cubical shape for the inserts <b>22</b>, other suitable geometric shapes, such as circular, triangular, rectangular, or hexagonal shapes, are also contemplated to suit the application.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is contemplated that the present support device <b>10</b> is made of polyurethane foam, or other similar materials that can be constructed to allow a hole, depression or orifice to be in the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The foam or other similar material also functions to provide more support and comfort for the user. In other embodiments, the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be made by using vinyl or other fabric that is filled with buckwheat or other similar materials. Similarly, it is also contemplated that the inserts <b>22</b> may be made by using vinyl or other fabric filled with buckwheat or other suitable materials. Preferred embodiments made using a fabric filled with particulate materials may contain the cavity, depression, hole or orifice in the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> to suit the application. Further, the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be affixed horizontally on one side with fabric adhesive, fabric, or other similar materials that can be used to hold the two head portions together to create a roll pillow.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> and <b>2</b>, as an example only, the inserts <b>22</b> control the height of the supporting area when the user sleeps. When the user rests on his supine position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), the user rests his neck directly in the center of the support device <b>10</b>, avoiding the inserts <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). The neck rests between the inserts <b>22</b>, making the device feel lower, and cradle the neck to give proper support in the neck and head areas. When the user sleeps on his side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), the head width measured from the back of the head to the nose, is typically longer than the neck width. Using the present device <b>10</b>, the user obtains support for the head and neck areas in various sleeping positions by moving the head to different areas on the device <b>10</b> during sleeping or exercise. Therefore, the user's head rests above the inserts <b>22</b> and support the head, making the pillow feel higher (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). As a result, the present device <b>10</b> supports the user's head in a proper height, and helps maintain a straight alignment of the neck.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the present support device <b>10</b> in a closed position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and the device in an open position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the preferred embodiment, the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are assembled together to create a cylindrical shape. For example, the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are attached together at a common connection seam <b>24</b>. Specifically, one longer side of the inner surface <b>20</b> of the first body portion <b>14</b> is attached substantially parallel to one longer side of the inner surface of the second body portion <b>16</b>. Two longer sides at the connection seam <b>24</b> are hingedly connected together, such that the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are rotatable with respect to each other. However, it is contemplated that the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are removably attached together using any suitable fastening mechanisms known in the art, such as snaps or Velcro&#xae; brand hook and loop products. As a result, the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are interfaced along a longitudinal plane defined by the inner surfaces <b>20</b> of the corresponding body portions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the present support device <b>10</b> in the open position is shown, featuring the inserts <b>22</b> being positioned in the cavity <b>18</b>. As illustrated, the cavity <b>18</b> is constructed and arranged to make the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> more pliable or less stiff as the user locates the neck or head on the support device <b>10</b>. For example, one or more inserts <b>22</b> are positioned in the cavity <b>18</b> of the second body portion <b>16</b> as per the user's preferences. As the user puts his head on the first body portion <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>), a general shape of the space defined by the cavity <b>18</b> changes when the device is compressed, and the cavity is filled by the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Depending on the needs or preferences, the user may selectively add additional inserts <b>22</b> in any targeted regions of the cavity <b>18</b>. It is contemplated that the inserts <b>22</b> are preferably tubular, but other suitable shapes, such as cylindrical or other geometric shapes are contemplated to suit the application. It is preferred that the inserts <b>22</b> are made of polyurethane foam, but other suitable materials known in the art are also contemplated to fill the cavity <b>18</b>. For example, two inserts <b>22</b> are placed in the cavity <b>18</b> according to a width of the user's neck.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, another embodiment of the present support device <b>10</b> is shown, having the common connection seam <b>24</b> permanently attached to the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> on one side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, two longer sides at the connection seam <b>24</b> are hingedly connected together, such that the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are rotatable with respect to each other. A notable feature is that the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are spaced at a predetermined distance, and flexibly elastically open and close as indicated by an arrow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), such that the inserts <b>22</b> are inserted into the cavities <b>18</b> without fully opening the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, another embodiment of the device <b>10</b> is generally designated <b>30</b>. Components shared with the device <b>10</b> are designated with identical reference numbers. A major difference featured in the device <b>30</b> is that the device includes at least one locking mechanism <b>32</b>, transitioning between a locked position and an unlocked position, for securely holding the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> together. At least one insertion opening or bore <b>34</b> being generally perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the device <b>30</b> is located on the outer surface <b>12</b> of each body portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and is dimensioned for accommodating insertion of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> into the corresponding body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each insertion opening <b>34</b> has a first or outer chamber <b>36</b> and a second or inner chamber <b>38</b>, wherein a diameter of the first chamber <b>36</b> is larger than the diameter of the second chamber <b>38</b>. Further, the diameter of the second chamber <b>38</b> is smaller than the diameter of the locking mechanism <b>32</b>, such that the locking mechanism is stopped at a bottom wall <b>40</b> of the first chamber <b>36</b> when the device <b>30</b> is in a locked position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). An elastic string or rope <b>42</b> is provided to hold the locking mechanisms <b>32</b> together with the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> sandwiched between. For example, as described in greater detail below, the string <b>42</b> is inserted into the locking mechanism <b>32</b> and the insertion opening <b>34</b> of the first body potion <b>14</b>, and then is inserted into the insertion opening <b>34</b> and the locking mechanism <b>32</b> of the second body portion <b>16</b>. When two opposite ends of the string <b>42</b> are locked by the locking mechanisms <b>32</b>, the first and second body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are securely held together under the tensile elongation force of the elastic string between the first and second body portions. It is also contemplated that the locking mechanism <b>32</b> can be used in other similar or suitable articles for securing the string or rope <b>42</b>, such as for tightly tying a shoelace or a garment string in clothing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10E</figref>, an exemplary operational sequence of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, it is contemplated that the locking mechanism <b>32</b> has at least one opening <b>44</b>, preferably located in a center, and dimensioned for receiving the string <b>42</b> (shown in phantom). A plurality of flexing protrusion sections <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10D</figref>), preferably at least two, are provided on an inner surface <b>48</b> of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> for locking and unlocking the string <b>42</b>. Further, the protrusion sections <b>46</b> are separated and surrounded by one or more channels or grooves <b>49</b>. Each protrusion section <b>46</b> has a first or inner end <b>50</b> adjacent the opening <b>44</b>, and an opposite second or outer end <b>52</b> adjacent a peripheral edge <b>54</b> of the locking mechanism <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An important feature of each protrusion section <b>46</b> is that the first end <b>50</b> has a thickness being greater than that of the second end <b>52</b>. Also, the first end <b>50</b> extends from the inner surface <b>48</b> near the opening <b>44</b> toward a central axis of the opening, such that the first ends of the protrusion sections <b>46</b> jointly compress toward the central axis of the opening and securely hold the string <b>42</b> when the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is in a locked position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the preferred embodiment, the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is generally dome-shaped and flexible to be compressed manually. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B-10E</figref>, the locking mechanism <b>32</b> transitions between the locked position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>) and an unlocked position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref>) by compressing and decompressing a top portion <b>56</b> of the locking mechanism inwardly and outwardly, causing flexing from a convex to a concave orientation of the top portion <b>56</b>. More specifically, when the top portion <b>56</b> of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is compressed inwardly toward the inner surface <b>48</b> of the locking mechanism, the dome-shaped mechanism becomes generally flat and the first ends <b>50</b> flare outwardly to unlock or release the string <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10D and 10E</figref>). Conversely, for locking the string <b>42</b> at a desired length, the top portion <b>56</b> of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is decompressed outwardly, and the locking mechanism <b>32</b> resiliently returns to its original dome shape, thereby locking or securely holding the string under the compression force of the first ends <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10E-10G</figref>, other suitable variations of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> are shown. It is contemplated that the opening <b>44</b> has a larger diameter near the top portion <b>56</b> than the diameter near an opposite bottom portion <b>57</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</figref>). Conversely, it is also contemplated that the opening <b>44</b> has a larger diameter near the opposite bottom portion <b>57</b> than the diameter near the top portion <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10G</figref>). Accordingly, the locking mechanism <b>32</b> operates without the protrusion sections <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10H-10I</figref>, when the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is provided with the protrusion sections <b>46</b>, similar suitable variations of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> are contemplated. For example, it is contemplated that the opening <b>44</b> has a larger diameter near the top portion <b>56</b> than the diameter near the opposite first end <b>50</b> of the protrusion section <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10H</figref>). Conversely, it is also contemplated that the opening <b>44</b> has a larger diameter near the opposite first end <b>50</b> than the diameter near the top portion <b>56</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10I</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, an exemplary variation of the locking mechanism <b>32</b> is illustrated. In this example, the locking mechanism <b>32</b> has two central openings <b>44</b> dimensioned for receiving two separate strings <b>42</b>, and the periphery <b>54</b> of the dome portion of the mechanism <b>32</b> has substantially an oval shape in a longitudinal direction. Other suitable shapes are also contemplated to suit the application. Further, the protrusion sections <b>46</b> have both generally triangular and quadrilateral shapes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). Likewise, other suitable geometric shapes are contemplated depending on the application.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B, an exemplary variation of the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; is illustrated. In this embodiment, the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; has a generally cylindrical shape, and includes at least one circular groove <b>58</b> formed on an outer surface of the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; transverse to a longitudinal axis of the insert, such that each groove matingly rests, in a complementary fashion, on the apex of one of a plurality of ripples or protrusions <b>60</b> disposed on an inner surface of the corresponding cavity <b>18</b>. Although the cubical shape is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the cylindrical shape is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for the inserts <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>&#x2032;, other suitable shapes are contemplated to suit the application. Further, any combinations of inserts having different shapes may be utilized with the grooves <b>58</b> depending on the user's needs and preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also included in the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; is a central opening <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) dimensioned for accommodating insertion of an auxiliary insert <b>64</b>, wherein the auxiliary insert is provided for varying a density of the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032;. For example, when the auxiliary insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; is slidably inserted into the central opening <b>62</b> of the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032;, depending on the density of the auxiliary insert, the support device <b>30</b> may exhibit different cushiness and flexibility for the user. Various other suitable types of auxiliary insert <b>64</b> are contemplated to suit the application. Optionally, an accessary device <b>66</b>, such as a vibrator, an alarm clock, a compact radio, and the like, is insertable in the auxiliary insert <b>64</b> or the insert <b>22</b>&#x2032; to suit the application. For example, the alarm clock <b>62</b> wakes up the user after a predetermined time period.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, it is preferred that a plurality of measurement indicators <b>68</b> are disposed on the inner surface <b>20</b> of at least one of the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in a longitudinal direction for more accurately placing the inserts <b>22</b>&#x2032; in the cavity <b>18</b>. The measurement indicators <b>68</b> are preferably comprised of a grid that is imprinted along the side of the inner cavity <b>18</b>, but other suitable methods known in the art are also contemplated. The measurement indicators <b>68</b> are optionally printed on materials such as felt, fabrics, and similar materials that can be adhered or affixed to the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, the inserts <b>22</b>&#x2032; are positioned and re-positioned more easily using the measurement indicators <b>68</b>. It is contemplated that the inserts <b>22</b>&#x2032; are attached to the defined cavity <b>18</b>, using hook and loop fasteners, such as Velcro&#xae; brand products, but other suitable methods known in the art, such as snap fasteners, are contemplated depending on different applications. It is preferred that the inserts <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>&#x2032; are made of polyurethane foam, or other similar materials that are configurable to matingly fit the cavity <b>18</b> of the corresponding body portion <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, other embodiments include a cover <b>70</b> for the support device <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>. It is contemplated that at least one of the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> is spray coated with vinyl-based coating to serve as the cover (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). In another embodiment, the cover <b>70</b> is made of vinyl or other suitable types of fabric that is filled with buckwheat or other similar materials to keep the head and neck areas of the user cooler (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the cover <b>70</b> may be a mesh-type elastic net for holding the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> together during use, and may enhance ventilation around the device <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>. In yet another embodiment, the cover <b>70</b> is fastened around the body portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, using zippers or hook and loop fasteners <b>72</b>, such as Velcro&#xae; brand products (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Other suitable fasteners known in the art, such as magnets or snap fasteners, are also contemplated.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to fire resistant panels including fire retardant treated fibers, and more particularly, to fire resistant panels including vertically oriented fire retardant treated fibers. Also disclosed are methods of fire blocking an article fire resistant panel.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Today, there is an increasing interest in adding flame resistant characteristics to mattresses and other furniture. For example, mattress and mattress sets sold in the United States are required to meet an open flame requirement as codified in 16 C.F.R. Part 1633 (2007). While materials used to meet these requirements vary from product to product, the overall approach has generally been to encase the mattress with a flame resistant barrier material underlying the outermost mattress layer e.g., fabric layer, ticking layer, and the like. The materials used by most mattress manufacturers are non-woven high loft or needle punched fiber batting; although, knitted sock-style barrier materials are also used albeit to a lesser extent.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Commercially available fire resistant battings are typically carded and cross lapped, whereby multiple thin layers of horizontally oriented fiber webs are laid on top of one another, wherein each successive fiber web is laid generally perpendicular to the preceding layer. One process for bonding the web together is via thermal bonding. With a thermal bonding process the layered web is then passed though an oven where a meltable binder such as a low melting polyester or low melting copolymer polyester serves as a binder to bind and hold the web together. Suitable low melting binders such as polyester can have a melting point generally less than 130&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the binder is a bi-component material having a core with a higher melting point than a surround encapsulating the core such that during thermal processing the surround is heated to a temperature greater than melting point of the surround but less than the melting point of the core to effect softening and/or melting of the surround, which functions to bind the fibers. Prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a cross sectional view depicting a non-woven batting <b>10</b> including horizontally oriented fibers webs <b>12</b>. Other commercially available fire resistant batting manufacturers employ the use of needles that penetrate the horizontally oriented fiber layered web through the web layers to effect fiber entanglement as a means to mechanically hold the web together. The resulting cross sectional structure can generally be defined as primarily composed of horizontally oriented fiber webs. Regardless of the method of manufacturer, typically, the fire resistant battings are of a relatively low loft and also of low resilience following compression such as may occur during use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While current flame retardant battings may meet the standards set forth in 16 C.F.R. Part 1633, many of these commercial offerings offer little in the way of user comfort. Moreover, commercially available fire resistant battings are generally insulative and do little with regard to temperature management and moisture control</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for improved fire resistant panels such as those employed as batting materials for use in mattresses, for use in upholstered furniture, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed herein In one embodiment, a fire resistant batting material comprises a layer having a top surface and a bottom surface, the layer comprising a plurality of substantially vertically oriented flame retardant treated fibers extending from the top surface to the bottom surface; and a binder material.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Disclosed herein are flame resistant panels for use in cushioning articles. By way of example, the flame resistant panels can be employed in mattresses as a batting material, wherein the fibers are substantially vertically oriented and at least a portion are flame retardant treated fibers. By use of the term &#x201c;treated&#x201d; it is meant that a fire retardant is applied to the fiber, wherein the fibers by themselves may have varying degrees of flame retardancy depending on the composition. Applicants have discovered that orienting the fire retardant treated fibers in a substantially vertical direction increases resiliency and the product's ability to recover due primarily to the change in fiber orientation from horizontal to vertical. The increase in resiliency has been found to translate into higher levels of comfort and product durability. Moreover, increased airflow was observed by orienting the fibers in the substantially vertical direction. Three dimensional thermal imaging has confirmed that mattress assemblies configured with flame resistant batting comprising substantially vertically oriented flame retardant treated fibers exhibited less retained heat compared to conventional cross-lapped and horizontally oriented fiber layers such as that shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, there is depicted a mattress <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment. The mattress <b>100</b> includes a central core layer <b>102</b> between pleated middle upholstery layers <b>104</b> (also referred to herein as a fiber batting material), and a quilt layer <b>106</b> provided on the outer face of the pleated middle upholstery layers <b>104</b>. The quilt layer <b>106</b> can extend around the sides of the mattress, where it is shown partially cut away to reveal layers behind quilt layer <b>106</b>. Other layers such as an insulator layer or the like (not shown) may also be included as may be desired for different applications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates an enlarged view of the mattress <b>100</b> corresponding with the circle indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The core layer <b>102</b> may comprise one or more foam layers, a coil spring layer, and combinations thereof. The quilt layer <b>106</b> is a composite layer of the mattress and can be made of foam or a cross-laid non-woven web of fibers stitched to the underside of a protective fabric cover, e.g., ticking layer, which provides a soft surface texture to the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pleated middle upholstery layers <b>104</b> comprise a pleated (vertically lapped) web of cross-laid fibers. In the pleated layer, the pleats are formed from a cross-laid non-woven web of fibers as will be described in greater detail below</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an alternative embodiment, the non-woven fiber batting material for the middle upholstery layer <b>104</b>&#x2032; can include a plurality of individual flame retardant treated fibers <b>102</b> substantially oriented in a vertical direction, i.e., generally transverse (y-direction) to a horizontal plane (x-direction) of the batting material.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;non-woven&#x201d; as used herein in connection with fabrics, fibrous compositions, textiles, materials, products and similar items means a structure that is produced by attaching, bonding and/or interlocking two or more of the same or different components, such as filaments, microfibers, fibers, fibrous compositions, threads or yarns, together, generally by loosely bonding them together, and using one or more of a variety of techniques that generally does not involve weaving or interlacing, but employs mechanical, chemical, thermal and/or solvent means, for example, using known needle punching, melt-blowing, spun bonding, wet-forming and various bonded carded web processes. Non-woven materials may be manufactured using fusing or chemical bonding techniques (with the use of binding agents, such as PVA or polyester) or similar techniques, which are known by those of skill in the art. This term generally does not include fabrics, textiles, fibrous compositions or materials that are woven, knitted, tufted, or those made using wool or other felting processes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The upholstery layer, i.e., batting material, including the flame retardant treated fiber in the substantially vertically oriented orientation of the present disclosure is also cost effective, soft, yet durable and suitable for various cushioning articles including, but not limited to a mattress component, mattress covers, comforters, bedspreads, quilts, coverlets, duvets, pillows, pillow covers, cushions, in addition to other home uses, protective apparel applications, and industrial end-use applications.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fibers employed in the vertically oriented flame retardant treated fiber batting material are not intended to be limited so long as a fire retardant can be applied and retained in an amount effective to provide the panel with a fire resistance that meets or exceeds 16 C.F.R. Part 1633. The fibers can be natural fibers and/or synthetic fibers. The use of natural fibers in bedding components is desirable due to the softness and durability associated with these fibers as well as the absorption properties of most natural cellulosic fibers. Suitable fibers include, without limitation, polyester, polyolefins such as a polypropylene and polyethylene, cellulosic fibers, cotton, rayon, wool, silk, acetate, nylon, lyocell, flax, ramie, jute, angora, kenaf, and the like, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fibers may have varying diameter and denier, be hollow or solid, or may be crimped. Blending different types of fibers may further contribute to resiliency of the batting material. The amounts will vary generally depending on the fiber composition, and flame retardant employed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the flame retardant treated fiber is lyocell, which is a regenerated cellulose fiber made from dissolving pulp (bleached wood pulp) and is commercially available as fibers under the brand name Tencel from Lenzing AG. The US Federal Trade commission defines lyocell as &#x201c;a cellulose fiber that is obtained by an organic solvent spinning process&#x201d; and classifies the lyocell fiber as a sub-category of rayon. Some main characteristics of lyocell fibers are that they are soft, absorbent, very strong when wet or dry, and resistant to wrinkles; all of which are generally desirable for a batting material. The moisture absorption properties provide improved moisture wicking, which is highly desirable for mattress applications.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> depict cross sections of various cellulosic fibers after immersion in dyed water, wherein lighter regions indicate minimal moisture absorption and darker regions indicate maximum moisture absorption. The various cellulosic fibers included cotton, a rayon commercially available under the trademark VISCOSE from the Lenzing Group, a modified rayon commercially available under the trademark MODAL from the Lenzing Group; and lyocell commercially available under the trademark TENCEL from the Lenzing Group. As shown, lyocell exhibited the greatest and most uniform moisture absorption as evidenced by the uniform dark color throughout the cross section. In contrast, moisture absorption for the MODAL and VISCOSE materials was observed to be confined to pores within the cross-sectional structure whereas moisture absorption in cotton was in centrally located pore. It is further noted that lyocell had a relatively smooth outer surface compared to VISCOSE and MODAL, which is believed to result in improved carding and provide a softer touch relative to materials having complex cross-sectional shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Man-made fibers can be produced to any desired cut length, which is generally determined by the equipment and product performance. For the vertically oriented batting material, the fibers to be fire retardant treated generally have a length of 0.25 to 4 inches; in other examples, a length of 0.5 to 3 inches, and in still other examples, a length of 1.5 to 3 inches. By way of example, for lyocell, rayon and/or polyester fibers, the cut lengths for carding are generally between 1.5 and 3 inches. For natural fibers such as cotton, the fiber length can generally vary from 0.5 to 1.6 inches. The non-woven fiber batting material when vertically oriented can also have a total thickness or loft of 0.5 inches (1.25 centimeters) or greater. While there is no real limitation on how thick the batting can be, for many typical applications, the thickness of the high loft batting need not be higher than 3 inches (7.6 cm), and for many mattress applications less than 2 inches (5 cm) is useful. The batting material can also generally have a basis weight of about 5 to 18 ounces per square yard (169 to 610 grams per square meter) and are preferably 8 to 11 ounces per square yard (271 to 373 grams per square meter). The total density of the batting material is generally aligned with the basis weights described above. Denser battings generally do not have the resiliency desired for use as cushioning in mattresses and other articles. As for battings that are less dense, the batting materials are oftentimes bulky to handle during fabrication and are generally compressed into the preferred density range when incorporated into a quilted composite. Thinner and denser battings also do not provide the desired softness, aesthetics, and may lack durability in application and with FR protection.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The fire retardant treated fibers may be chemically, thermally or mechanically bonded to improve structural integrity. Chemical binders can generally be applied to the flame retardant treated fibers by impregnating, coating and/or spraying. Exemplary chemical binders include, without limitation, acrylate polymers, styrene-butadiene copolymers, and vinyl acetate polymers. Thermally bonded fibers generally include the addition of low melting polymeric materials, e.g., low molecular weight polyester fibers, to the flame retardant treated fibers, wherein further processing to form the web results in melting and/or partial melting of the low molecular weight binder so as to form bonds under controlled heating between the fibers of the batting material. As for mechanical bonding, a web of fibers including the flame retardant treated fibers can be processed to increase fiber entanglement. There are generally two types of mechanical bonding: needle punching and hydro-entanglement. Needle punching can be used on most fiber types and generally includes the use of specially designed needles that are pushed and pulled through the web to entangle the fibers. Webs of different characteristics can be needled together to produce a gradation of properties difficult to achieve by other means. Hydro-entanglement employs water jets to effect entanglement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The flame resistant panels made using treated fire retardant fibers are comprised of a blend in an amount that meets and/or exceeds the flammability standards set forth in 16 CFR 1633. Flame resistance generally depends on the fiber composition, flame retardant chemical that is applied, and the flame retardant loadings. In most embodiments, at least 50% of the fibers are fire retardant treated fibers. In other embodiments, at least 60% of the fibers are fire retardant treated fibers; and in still other embodiments, at least 80% of the fibers are fire retardant treated fibers. The remaining fibers in the panel composition can comprise untreated fibers, binder fibers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, multiple layers of vertically oriented fibers are stackedly arranged to provide a desired thickness for the batting material application. The stacked layers may be subjected to chemical, thermal and/or mechanical bonding to provide the desired amount of structural integrity between layers. For example, a binder such as a low molecular weight polyester and/or adhesive may be used intermediate the layers to provide structural integrity or the stacked arrangement may be needle punched to effect fiber entanglement.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Unexpectedly, it has also been discovered that when converted into a vertically oriented product using the treated fibers such lyocell or rayon, less flame retardant treated fibers are required to form the panel and provide an equivalent fire rating compared to prior art carded and cross-lapped horizontally oriented materials having a similar loft. For example, a fiber batting material at a density of 1 ounce per square foot that met and/or exceeded the product safety standard codified in 16 C.F.R PART 1633 required only 70% of substantially vertically oriented fire retardant fibers compared to 80% required for fire retardant treated fibers that had been horizontally oriented and cross-lapped as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0032">It has further been discovered that an ammonium polyphosphate fire retardant treated lyocell fiber batting material at a density of 0.8 ounces per square foot also met and/or exceeded the product safety standard codified in 16 C.F.R Part 1633 required, which represents a significant and unexpected result compared to prior art batting materials. As noted above, the prior art batting materials generally needed 80% fire retardant treated fibers at a density of 1 ounce per square foot to meet this codified standard whereas the data provided in Table 2 below indicates that only 70% of substantially vertically oriented fire retardant fibers at density of 0.8 ounce per square foot was needed to meet the product safety standard. The results provide a significant commercial advantage since less basis weight and materials are needed to meet the standards provided in 16 C.F.R 1633. The data further suggests that even lower percentages of flame retardant treated fibers and/or lower basis weights may be possible and still meet the product safety standard codified in 16 C.F.R Part 1633.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0033">Moreover, it has been discovered that unlike most conventional fire retardant fibers, application of a fire retardant chemical permeates substantially throughout the cross sectional area of the lyocell fiber, which, without being bound by theory, attributes to lower amounts of flame retardant treated fibers required in the product blend to meet and/or exceed flammability standards described in 16 CFR Part 1633.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0034">At least a portion of the fibers are treated with flame retardant chemistry, which may be provided as a durable or a non-durable finish. Durable flame retardant finishes are not removed by exposure to water or handling.

<p id="p-0051" num="0048">The chemistry may be added to the fibers using application methods known to those skilled in the art. The flame retardant may be singular, or in combination with other finishing chemistries like antistats, lubricants, binders, antimicrobials, color, water and oil repellents, surfactants, and other chemical auxiliaries known to the art. Following the application of the chemistry, which may be done using water or other solvents as a vehicle for uniformly distributing the treatment, the substrate is centrifuged and dried. Exemplary application processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,736,696 to Tintoria-Piana, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0049">By way of example, a closed-loop system and process can used for applying fire retardant chemicals to the fibers. The untreated fibers are first positioned in a vessel such as a dye machine, which circulates the fire retardant chemicals. The fire retardant chemicals may be in the form of a solution, a dispersion or emulsion. In some embodiments, the fire retardant chemicals are in the form of an aqueous solution. The fire retardant chemical solution, dispersions, emulsion or otherwise may be at room temperature or at an elevated temperature. In most embodiments, the fire retardant chemical solution, dispersions, emulsion or otherwise will be at a temperature from about 4&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C.; in other embodiments, from 20 to 50&#xb0; C. and in still other embodiments, at about ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0050">After absorption of the fire retardant composition on and/or into the fibers, non-absorbed fire retardant chemicals are recovered and re-used on subsequent batches of fibers. In some embodiments, the re-use of fire retardant chemicals can take place in the same vessel that is used to treat successive batches of fiber. Alternatively, recovery can be achieved by directing the non-absorbed fire retardant composition into a second dye machine containing additional fibers, or by extracting the fire retardant composition by centrifugation or other means, or by a combination of the two processes. The treated fibers may then be rinsed and dried. Alternatively, the fire retardant may be applied to the fibers at a subsequent stage of manufacturing, e.g., after blending with the binder fibers or forming the non-woven web, or after the non-woven web has been pleated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0051">Advantageously with respect to applying a fire retardant to lyocell fibers, because of its high moisture absorption and fiber cross section, it has been discovered that the fire retardant can be selected to permeate substantially throughout the cross sectional fiber structure unlike many types of fibers where the fire retardant coats exposed surfaces with minimal or no impregnation of the fire retardant into the fiber core. In one embodiment, ammonium polyphosphate can applied to the lyocell fiber and has been found to permeate substantially throughout a cross section of the lyocell fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0052">The batting from the treated fibers may be formed using one of several processes for converting a source of fiber into vertically oriented fibers as is generally known in the art. By way of example, the vertically oriented fibers can be formed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,801, incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the peaks of the vertically oriented fibers in the batting material may be brushed or needle punched to improve the entwining of individual fibers of one peak into adjacent peaks. Adjacent peaks of vertically oriented fibers may be of substantially the same height, or alternatively may have different heights in a repeating pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0053">In some embodiments, the vertically oriented fibers can be in the form of pleats as discussed above. The pleats are formed from a cross laid non-woven web of fibers that can be less than 5 millimeters (mm) (i.e., about 0.2 inches) thick before pleating and in other embodiments, about 2 mm thick (e.g., a mattress approximately 2000 mm long can have about 500 pleats, each or two sheets). As previously described above, in most embodiments, the fibers are 0.25 to 4 inches long. During manufacture, once pleated, the pleated layer can be cross-needled to provide additional structural strength.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0054">The pleating can provide a pleated layer having a thickness less than about 2 inches. By means of a carding process when the fibers are laid, greater than 75%, and greater than 90% in other embodiments of the fibers of the non-woven web are aligned substantially vertically oriented relative to the plane defined by an underlying mattress or cushioning article, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0055">As noted above, the non-woven web or the pleated layer can also include a binder fiber, which bonds the fibers to form a fiber mat. The binder fiber can be a bi-component fiber having a standard polyester core, e.g., having a melting point of about 250&#xb0; C. within a low melting temperature polyester surround having a melting point of about 130&#xb0; C. During manufacture, the non-woven web can be heat treated above the melting temperature of the fiber surround but beneath the temperature of the fiber core to cause the bi-component fibers to bind the fire retardant treated fibers. After pleating, the non-woven web can be cross-needled to enhance its strength. Optionally, the pleated layer may be cut during the manufacturing process as a result of the vertically lapped arrangement of fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0056">Flame retardant loading generally depends of the type of flame retardant and is generally at a loading of 13 to 20% based on a total weight of the fiber and the fire retardant.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0057">Due to the vertical arrangement of the fibers in the pleated layer, when a load is applied to the cushioned article, e.g., mattress, the vertical arrangement of the fibers in the layer supports the load in a spring-like manner, compressing vertically to accommodate the shape of the load without flattening in the neighboring regions. In effect, the vertically oriented fibers, e.g., the vertically lapped formed pleats, act as vertical springs with cross needling to effect limited attachment between pleats but without causing pleats to flatten except under load. Moreover, when load is removed, the vertically oriented fibers readily recover it shape due to the independently spring-like nature of the vertically oriented fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0058">Advantageously, the vertically oriented fibers, e.g., vertically lapped formed pleats, have a low area density, which may result in lighter products and correspondingly less expensive manufacture and transport.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0059">In order that the disclosure may be more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples, which are intended to illustrate the invention, but not limit the scope thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to an improved structure of an inflatable mattress, in particular, to an improved structure of an inflatable mattress comprising a plurality of connection pieces made of a composite material to attach an upper leather article with a lower leather article of the inflatable mattress in order to significantly increase a structural strength of the inflatable mattress and to lower an overall weight thereof such that a useful lifetime of the inflatable mattress is increased, which is a technical field related to a new type of improved inflatable mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most of the inflatable mattresses currently known adapt the design of an inflatable air bag with the utilization of an air valve provided at the side of the mattress for pumping air into the mattress for inflation thereof or to release the air by opening the air valve in order to reduce the size of the mattress for storage and package purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based on such fundamental structure, since most of the traditional inflatable mattresses are of the design of the aforementioned hollow air bag, the hollow portion between the mattress surface and the bottom needs to be provided with a plurality of connection pieces. Some of such connection pieces are of a belt structure, some are of a slat structure and some are of a column structure, which are provided to connect between the mattress surface and the bottom thereof for the purpose of forming the desired shape of the mattress after the inflation while, at the same time, increasing the structural strength of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the aforementioned inflatable mattresses require the use belt shaped connection pieces, slat shaped connection pieces or column shaped connection pieces such that all of the two ends of the connection pieces are connected together with the mattress (such as using the high frequency welding manufacturing process for connection altogether). If the connection piece is broken or the connecting portion is loose, then such one connection piece loses its effect such that the mattress is deformed and the useful lifetime is shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nevertheless, if a greater number of connection pieces is used to improve the aforementioned situation, then there would be greater uses of materials with an excess of connection pieces, causing the manufacturing costs to be higher and the overall weight of the inflatable mattress to increase and also making it inconvenient to the operation as well. All of such shortcomings are common to traditional inflatable mattresses.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, the present invention provides an improved structure of an inflatable mattress capable of overcoming the aforementioned defects and shortcomings of the traditional inflatable mattresses effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a primary objective of the present invention is to provide a design using a plurality of connection pieces made of a composite material to connect with each other between an upper leather article and an lower leather article of the inflatable mattress such that the structural strength of the inflatable mattress can be significantly increased, the overall weight thereof can be reduced and the useful lifetime of the improved structure of the inflatable mattress can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further objective of the present invention is to provide an improved inflatable mattress in which the aforementioned design for each one of the connection is of an increased structural strength for the connection pieces themselves and an increased number of the connecting portions with the mattress as well as a lowered weight of the connection pieces themselves in order to lower the overall weight of the mattress such that it is of improvement and advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve the aforementioned objectives, the present invention utilizes the following technical solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An improved structure of an inflatable mattress of the present invention comprises an upper leather article, a lower leather article, a circumferential member and a plurality of connection pieces to form an assembly construction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The aforementioned upper leather article, the lower leather article and the circumferential member are identical to the ones of the traditional mattress to form a sealed hollow mattress body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The circumferential member comprises an air valve on the circumferential member in order to pump air into and release air from the hollow inner portion of the mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each one of the connection pieces comprises an upper slat and a lower slat with a symmetrical structure; a mesh fabric is provided between the upper slats and the lower slats to connect therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each one of the upper slats is connected to the upper leather article of the mattress; each one of the lower slats is connected to the lower leather article of the mattress; the upper leather article and the lower leather article of the mattress are attached to each other with the plurality of the connection pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In terms of the design, the upper slat and the lower slat of each one of the aforementioned connection pieces are of a cross section of a symmetrical Y shape. Such design allows the connecting portions between each one of the connection pieces and the inflatable mattress to be increased in order to strength the connecting structure between each one of the connection pieces and the inflatable mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The design of the mesh fabric connected between the upper slats and the lower slats allow a greater structural strength for each one of the connection pieces itself and, at the same time, reduce the leather usage of the connection slats in order to allow the overall weight of the inflatable mattress to be light and to achieve the predetermined objectives of the present invention.</p>
