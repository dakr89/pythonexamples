<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a novel ruthenium-diamine complex, and a method for selectively producing optically active alcohols and optically active amines, which are important as precursors for synthesizing pharmaceuticals and functional materials, the method using the ruthenium-diamine complex as a catalyst.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Many asymmetric reactions including asymmetric reduction have been developed, and many asymmetric reactions have been reported in which asymmetric metal complexes having optically active phosphine ligands are used. On the other hand, many reports have shown that complexes in which optically active nitrogen compounds are coordinated to transition metals, such as ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium, for example, have excellent performances as catalysts for asymmetric synthesis reactions. Moreover, to enhance the performances of these catalysts, various optically active nitrogen compounds have been developed (Non Patent Literatures 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). In particular, M. Wills et al. have reported that complexes in which a diamine moiety and an aromatic ring (arene) moiety coordinated to the ruthenium complex are linked by a carbon chain exhibit higher activities than conventional catalysts (Non Patent Literatures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.).</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0014">However, conventional asymmetric synthesis methods using any of these complexes result in insufficient catalytic activity or insufficient enantiomeric excess in some cases depending on the target reaction or the reaction substrate of the reaction. Hence, further development of a complex has been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0015">The present inventors have focused on the chain moiety which links the arene moiety coordinated to ruthenium and the diamine moiety, and have found that a complex in which (i) at least one substituent is present on the aromatic ring in the arene moiety, and (ii) the length of the carbon chain of the linking chain moiety is 4 has a high catalytic activity and achieves an excellent enantiomeric excess.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0001">The present invention relates to a rhodium complex catalyst and a production method of an amine compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to a rhodium complex catalyst effective for the production of an optically active amine compound which is used as a compound useful for a medicament, a pesticide and the like, or a starting material thereof or an intermediate thereof, and a production method of an amine compound.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">As a method for obtaining an optically active amine compound, a method including asymmetric hydrogenation of a prochiral ketimine compound obtained from a carbonyl compound in the presence of an asymmetric metal complex catalyst is available. For example, a method including asymmetric hydrogenation of a ketimine compound in the presence of a rhodium metal complex using an optically active diphosphine compound such as SKEWPHOS and the like as a ligand (non-patent document 1), and a method including asymmetric hydrogenation of tri-substituted enamine in the presence of an iridium metal complex using an optically active phosphine compound such as JOSIPHOS and the like as a ligand, and iodine (non-patent document 2) are disclosed. However, these methods show low catalyst activity and do not show satisfactory results in the asymmetric hydrogenation of tetra-substituted enamine considered difficult to be hydrogenated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">Optically active hexahydropyrroloquinolines are optically active amines industrially useful as synthetic intermediates for optically active physiologically active compound and the like, which are utilized as medicaments and pesticides. Optically active hexahydropyrroloquinolines are used as, for example, important intermediates for NK2 receptor antagonists considered to be useful for the prophylaxis or treatment of neurokinin A-dependent pathology such as lung diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, central nervous diseases, urinary organ diseases, analgesic diseases and the like. While the synthesis of hexahydropyrroloquinolines is found in several disclosures, a further synthesis method that can be applied industrially has been desired (patent documents 1, 2, 3).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">Transition metal complexes having an optically active diphosphine compound as a ligand are extremely useful as a catalyst for asymmetric reactions, and a number of catalysts have heretofore been developed. For example, axially chiral diphosphine compound represented by BINAP, diphosphine compounds having chirality on carbon such as DIOP and the like, diphosphine compounds having chirality on phosphorus such as DIPAMP and the like are known. Among the diphosphine compounds having chirality on carbon, pentane-2,4-diylbis(diphenylphosphine) (hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as SKEWPHOS) is widely used. Depending on the kind of substrate, reactivity, stereoselectivity, catalyst efficiency and the like are not sufficient, and therefore, various optically active phosphines have been produced and reported (non-patent documents 3, 4, patent document 4).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005">As a production method of SKEWPHOS and SKEWPHOS analogs, some have been disclosed heretofore (non-patent documents 5, 6, patent document 4). However, these methods are industrially unsatisfactory since they use alkyllithium, which is industrially difficult to handle, when obtaining phosphine lithium salt and phosphine borane lithium salt, they include severe reaction conditions for the synthesis of phosphine lithium salt or phosphine borane lithium salt, and synthesis steps of diphosphine compound or diphosphine diborane compound, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0006">As for SKEWPHOS analogs, a production method including asymmetric hydrogenation in the presence of ruthenium metal complex using an optically active pentane-2,4-diylbis(bis(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)phosphine) compound represented by</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The present invention aims to provide an efficient synthesis method of SKEWPHOS analogs and a rhodium complex catalyst therefor and a production method of an optically active amine compounds, particularly, optically active to hexahydropyrroloquinolines which is superior to conventional transition metal complex catalysts using an optically active diphosphine compound as a ligand, and the development of an additive advantageous for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means of Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In view of the aforementioned problems, the present inventors have studied, as an industrial production method of an optically active diphosphine ligand SKEWPHOS and SKEWPHOS analogs, avoidance of lithium salification using alkyllithium and extremely low temperature reaction. As a result, the present inventors have found that the reaction proceeds under mild conditions by using a particular base, and completed an industrial production method of SKEWPHOS and SKEWPHOS analogs. Furthermore, rhodium complex catalyst using PTBP-SKEWPHOS as a ligand asymmetrically hydrogenates tetra-substituted enamine in the presence of a compound having a particular aromatic hydroxy group and a particular acetal to construct an optically active hexahydropyrroloquinoline ring, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0236" num="0142">In the reaction of [Method A-1] or [Method A-2], a base is generally used and, as the base to be used, an inorganic base or an organic base can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0143">Examples of the inorganic base include alkali metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide and the like; alkali metal alkoxide having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, lithium ethoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, lithium propoxide, sodium propoxide, potassium propoxide, lithium isopropoxide, sodium isopropoxide, potassium isopropoxide, potassium tert-butoxide and the like; alkali metal thioalkoxide having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as sodium thiomethoxide and the like; carbonate such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate and the like; hydrogen carbonate such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate and the like; acetate such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate and the like; phosphate such as tripotassium phosphate, sodium phosphate and the like; monohydrogen phosphate such as potassium monohydrogen phosphate, sodium monohydrogen phosphate and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0144">Examples of the organic base include aliphatic amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, diethylamine, diisopropylamine, cyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine and the like; aromatic amines such as pyridine, picoline, N,N-dimethylaniline and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0145">As the inorganic base, specifically, lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium monohydrogen phosphate and tripotassium phosphate are preferable. As the organic base, aliphatic amine is more preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0146">The amount of the base to be used is about 0.01-about 100 mol, preferably about 0.1-about 10 mol, per 1 mol of a compound represented by the formula (2) or the formula (4), which is the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0147">The reaction of [Method A-1] or [Method A-2] is generally performed in a solvent. Such solvent is not particularly limited as long as it is inert to the reaction and solubilizes the starting compound and catalyst. For example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene and the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as heptane, hexane and the like; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and the like; ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol and the like; nitriles such as acetonitrile and the like; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide and the like; sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide and the like are used. These solvents can be mixed and used at an appropriate ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0148">The amount of the solvent to be used is appropriately determined according to the solubility of a compound represented by the formula (2) or the formula (4), which is the substrate and the like. For example, when alcohol (preferably methanol) is used as a solvent, the reaction can be performed in a state closer to no solvent or in a not less than 100-fold weight of a solvent relative to a compound represented by the formula (2) or the formula (4). Generally, about 2- to about 50-fold weight of a solvent is preferably used relative to a compound represented by the formula (2) or the formula (4).</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0149">Hydrogenation can be performed by any of batch type and continuous type reactions. Hydrogenation is performed in the presence of hydrogen, and the hydrogen pressure is, for example, 0.01-200 atm, preferably 1-15 atm.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0150">The reaction temperature is generally &#x2212;30&#xb0; C.-100&#xb0; C., preferably 0-80&#xb0; C., more preferably 10-50&#xb0; C. The reaction time is generally 0.1-72 hr, preferably 1-48 hr.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0151">A compound represented by the formula (3) or the formula (5), which is obtained by a hydrogenation reaction, may be purified by a known means (e.g., fractional recrystallization, chiral column method, diastereomeric salt formation method). When an optically active amine is to be produced, purification by crystallization according to a diastereomeric salt formation method is preferable to obtain a salt of a compound represented by the formula (3) or the formula (5) having a high optical purity.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="2">(Production Method of Optically Active Hexahydropyrroloquinolines)</heading>
<p id="p-0246" num="0152">By performing the reaction of [Method A-1] or [Method A-2] simultaneously with other reaction in combination, a more complicated compound can be produced. For example, a reaction example for obtaining a compound represented by the formula (8) from a compound represented by the following formula (7) can be mentioned.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a novel ruthenium-diamine complex, and a method for selectively producing optically active alcohols and optically active amines, which are important as precursors for synthesizing pharmaceuticals and functional materials, the method using the ruthenium-diamine complex as a catalyst.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Many asymmetric reactions including asymmetric reduction have been developed, and many asymmetric reactions have been reported in which asymmetric metal complexes having optically active phosphine ligands are used. On the other hand, many reports have shown that complexes in which optically active nitrogen compounds are coordinated to transition metals, such as ruthenium, rhodium, and iridium, for example, have excellent performances as catalysts for asymmetric synthesis reactions. Moreover, to enhance the performances of these catalysts, various optically active nitrogen compounds have been developed (Non Patent Literatures 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). In particular, M. Wills et al. have reported that complexes in which a diamine moiety and an aromatic ring (arene) moiety coordinated to the ruthenium complex are linked by a carbon chain exhibit higher activities than conventional catalysts (Non Patent Literatures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.).</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0014">However, conventional asymmetric synthesis methods using any of these complexes result in insufficient catalytic activity or insufficient enantiomeric excess in some cases depending on the target reaction or the reaction substrate of the reaction. Hence, further development of a complex has been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">The present inventors have focused on the chain moiety which links the arene moiety coordinated to ruthenium and the diamine moiety, and have found that a complex in which (i) at least one substituent is present on the aromatic ring in the arene moiety, and (ii) the length of the carbon chain of the linking chain moiety is 4 has a high catalytic activity and achieves an excellent enantiomeric excess.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0017">The present invention provides a novel ruthenium-diamine complex in which a diamine moiety and an arene moiety coordinated to the ruthenium complex is linked by a carbon chain. The ruthenium-diamine complex of the present invention has an extremely higher catalytic activity than conventional hydrogen transfer-type complexes, and hence is useful as various hydrogenation catalysts. Moreover, the ruthenium complex of the present invention in which a substituent such as an alkyl group is present on the aromatic ring and the length of the carbon chain of the linking chain moiety is 4 is excellent in stereoselectivity and achieves a high enantiomeric excess, and hence makes it possible to obtain a target substance with a high optical purity and a high yield in a hydrogen transfer reaction or a hydrogenation reaction.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is in the field of garments and is more particularly related to an undergarment for men.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various forms of undergarments have been developed over the ages for men. The currently available briefs for men are generally constructed with one or more trunk panels and overlapping front panels. The overlapping front panels typically define a singular fly opening for access through the outermost panel to the penis for the purpose of urination. Several attempts have been made to solve the numerous problems associated with the known brief constructions, such as discomfort, lack of support and embarrassment due to unsightly bulging or slippage of the male genital organs. Hence there is clearly a need for a male underwear brief with various options for supporting and exposing the male genital organ in different ways and to provide a comfortable wearing for 24 hours continuously in a day.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment of the invention a male underwear brief is provided, comprising an elastic waistband, cloth material joined circumferentially to the waistband, contiguously forming a back panel, an upper front panel, and a crotch panel proceeding from a lower region of the back panel to the front and upward, a first and a second leg opening for a person's legs, edges of the leg openings reinforced with elastic material, and a horizontally oriented and aligned fly opening in front. The back panel and the crotch panel are joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, the crotch panel proceeding upward in front ending at a first edge attached continuously to the crotch panel and to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings, and the upper front panel is joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, ending at a second edge attached to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings overlapping the first edge below the first edge, the overlapped material forming a horizontal fly that opens upward into the brief between the first and second edges.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment the underwear brief further comprises a first elastic band joined continuously along the first edge, attached to the reinforced edges of the leg openings. Also in one embodiment the underwear brief further comprises a first elastic band joined continuously along the second edge, and attached to the reinforced edges of the leg openings. Still in one embodiment the underwear brief further comprises a first elastic band joined continuously along the first edge, attached to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, and a second elastic band joined continuously along the second edge, attached to the reinforced edges of the leg openings. In one embodiment there is a third horizontal elastic band joined only to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings over the upper front panel above and parallel to the first and second horizontal elastic bands.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the male underwear brief the upper front panel comprises material such that the upper front panel joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings from the second elastic band upwards to a first point on the reinforced edges of the leg openings a specific distance along the reinforced edges of the leg openings from the lower edge of the second elastic band, and joined from above to the reinforced edges of the leg openings down to a second point on the reinforced edges of the leg openings lower on the leg openings from the first point, creates an extension loop of two layers of material extending to the front a distance equal to the specific distance and ending in a folded edge, which extension, folded down along a line from the first point on the reinforced edges of the leg openings, positions the folded edge of the extension along the lower edge of the first and second elastic bands, and the extension, then joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, forms a pouch from inside the underwear brief.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also in one embodiment the third elastic band is positioned horizontally across the leg openings under the material of the front panel just below the second points, forming a support for the pouch formed. In yet another embodiment a pouch is formed by controlling the cut of the upper front panel to provide sufficient width such that the upper front panel, joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, provides a forward extending pouch.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is a side perceptive view of a male underwear brief <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Male underwear brief <b>100</b> comprises an elastic waistband <b>101</b> attached to the upper periphery of the brief <b>100</b>, cloth material joined circumferentially to waistband <b>101</b> which forms a back panel <b>106</b>, an upper front panel <b>104</b>, and a crotch panel <b>105</b> proceeding from a lower region of the back panel <b>106</b> to the front and upward, a first and a second opening <b>102</b> for a person's legs and a horizontally oriented and aligned fly opening <b>103</b>. The edges of the first and the second openings <b>102</b> for the person's legs are reinforced in most embodiments, and in most cases the reinforced edges are of elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment horizontally oriented and aligned fly opening <b>103</b> is positioned low in the front of brief <b>100</b>. Back panel <b>106</b> and crotch panel <b>105</b> are joined to reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>. The upper front panel is joined to the reinforced edges of leg openings <b>102</b> as well, and ends at a horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> attached continuously to upper front panel <b>104</b>. Horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> is attached to each of the reinforced edges of leg openings <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment the upper extent of the material of crotch panel <b>105</b> is at line <b>110</b>. This creates an overlapped fly opening <b>103</b> open from below upward into the brief, of a vertical dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;. This dimension may vary depending on the placement of both the upper end of the crotch panel, and the lower end of the upper front panel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>is cross-section through horizontal fly <b>103</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>taken along section line <b>1</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b><i>b </i>into the brief. In this particular embodiment there is elastic band <b>108</b> overlying the upward-extending crotch panel material <b>105</b>, but there is no band on the upper edge of crotch panel <b>105</b>, which ends at line <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>). In some cases this edge may be hemmed. Again, the placement and attachment of the crotch panel material and the upper panel material determine dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;, which may vary accordingly. The embodiment represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>may be considered a &#x201c;one-band&#x201d; embodiment. In yet another embodiment upper front panel <b>104</b> may end without an elastic band, at an edge that may be, for example, hemmed as well, and this particular embodiment may be considered a &#x201c;no band&#x201d; embodiment, but nevertheless creates an upwardly opening overlapped horizontal fly opening of dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>illustrates the cross-section of the fly panel in another embodiment, wherein another elastic band <b>107</b> is added at the upper edge of the crotch panel. The elastic bands may be of equal height and weight, or different, and the overlap may be variously managed as described above. The embodiment represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>may be considered a &#x201c;two-band&#x201d; embodiment. At least one other two-band embodiment is described additionally below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side perceptive view of male underwear brief <b>100</b> illustrating another embodiment of a &#x201c;two-band&#x201d; brief, wherein a front pouch is also provided, not shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>To better illustrate how a pouch is formed with the upper front panel, the upper front panel in shown in an open position in subsequent stages of assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Crotch panel <b>105</b> proceeds upward from a lower region of back panel <b>106</b> to the front and ends at a first horizontal elastic band <b>107</b> joined securely to each of first and second leg openings <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c. </i>At this stage of assembly edges of upper front panel <b>104</b> are stitched to the elastic leg bands <b>102</b> down to point (a) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Note that point (a) is repeated on the opposite leg opening, although not seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

One side of upper front panel <b>104</b> is joined to the leg openings on both sides at two different points (a), (b) to form an extended loop as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The opposite edges of horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> are stitched respectively to the reinforced edges of leg openings <b>102</b> at the opposite sides, and are positioned in one embodiment below the position of band <b>107</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c. </i>This is optional placement in different embodiments, and the position of band <b>108</b> may vary, affecting the dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c. </i>Further, the edges of the upper front panel are stitched to the reinforced edges of the leg openings as shown, down to the horizontal fly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">First horizontal elastic band <b>107</b> and second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> are only stitched to the edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>, leaving an opening up from the bottom of the horizontal fly to the inside of the brief.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view of the male underwear brief, essentially the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c, </i>illustrating the arrangement of the two horizontal elastic bands in this example. The bands are only stitched to the elastic leg bands <b>102</b>. This leaves an opening up from the bottom of the fly to the inside of the upper front panel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side perceptive view of male underwear brief <b>100</b>, illustrating the placement of a third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b>, according to an embodiment. The upper front panel is folded, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with point (a) and point (b) relatively close together in this example, on both leg openings as shown. Third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> is joined only to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b> over the upper front panel <b>104</b> just above and parallel to second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b>. The position of band <b>109</b> is below the attachment points (b) intentionally to provide support in use, as the pouch is intended to support a user's organ or organs.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> is stitched above second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> and below attachment points (b) to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>, but not to the upper front panel <b>104</b> or anywhere else. Since the third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> is stitched only to the reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>, it can be pulled outward. In alternative embodiments points (b) may be positioned on the edges of the leg openings further below points (a), providing a greater opening from inside into the pouch that is formed by the folded material, or the third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> may be stitched continuously across the front panel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross sectional view of the male underwear brief illustrating the arrangement of the three horizontal elastic bands in this example. Crotch panel <b>105</b> proceeds upwardly from a lower region of the back panel to the front and ends at first horizontal elastic band <b>107</b> attached continuously to the crotch panel and to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings. Upper front panel <b>104</b> is joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings and ends at horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> attached continuously to the upper front panel. Band <b>108</b> is attached to each of the reinforced edges of leg openings typically at some distance below band <b>107</b>. This leaves an opening up from the bottom of the horizontal fly to the inside of the upper front panel <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In alternative embodiments the position of band <b>108</b> may be varied from directly over band <b>107</b> to substantially below band <b>107</b>, varying the vertical dimension of the upwardly-extending opening into the brief. Band <b>109</b> is stitched above and parallel to band <b>108</b> to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings at a distance that may vary, but is typically placed to support the pouch developed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side perceptive view of male underwear brief <b>100</b> with the fold of the upper front panel in a closed position. The extended loop of upper front panel <b>104</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, has been folded downward. The folded loop is brought down, and the top edge of the loop comes right to the bottom edge of horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> at line <b>111</b>. The side edges of the loop are stitched along the reinforced edges of the leg openings down to the horizontal fly thereby forming a pouch from within the brief along a horizontal line from points (a) and (b) on each leg opening. The relative positions of bands <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b> are shown now in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as dotted lines, because they are behind the folded down pouch material. It should be noted that the extent of material <b>104</b> may be adjusted, depending on a chosen distance between points (a) and (b), which define an opening size into an internal pouch, to provide the proper placement of edge <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In still another embodiment of the invention a front pouch may be formed by fabric cut, rather than by folding the fabric of the upper front panel as described in detail above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>is a perspective view of the brief showing horizontal elastic bands <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b>. In this embodiment upper panel <b>104</b> is cut to provide a width w<b>1</b> across points (a) to establish a dimension across the front of the brief, and another width w<b>2</b> across points (b) below point (a) for the same purpose. W<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b> will typically be not the same, but w<b>1</b> greater than w<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b </i>illustrates an exemplary cut for upper front panel material <b>104</b> with points (a) and (b) and widths w<b>1</b> and w<b>2</b>. The edges are curved outwardly as shown between points (a) and (b). It is essential that the distance along the curve of the cut fabric from points (a) and (b) on each side be the same distance as between (a) and (b) on each leg band of the brief. This way, when the fabric is sewn to the leg bands on each side an outwardly-extending pouch may be formed. This pouch in use supporting a user's organ or organs will tend to form outwardly and downward as well.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Horizontal fly <b>103</b> can be stretched more than 25% to let the penis and scrotum, or just the scrotum out and to provide a slack-line-type closure for a supportive upper pouch (i.e. for upper front panel) <b>103</b> to hold the penis, or the penis and scrotum. Horizontal fly <b>103</b> creates a comfortable collar close to the user's torso and the second horizontal elastic band, like a full-width fabric eyebrow, shrouds 1&#x2033;-2&#x2033; of the exposed organ, when the organ is pulled out. The first, second and third horizontal elastic bands may have a width of &#xbd;&#x2033;-&#x215d;&#x2033; and are wrapped up for comfort in the brief <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the male underwear brief in this example provides various options for the person to provide a continuous comfortable wearing for 24 hours every day. In one option the pouch formed of the extra material of the upper front panel covers and lifts both the penis and the scrotum, while slit-aperture horizontal fly <b>103</b> closes under the overhanging weight of the penis with the scrotum under. The pouch formed with the extended loop of the extra material of the upper front panel absorbs urine, reduces rolling and squeezing of organs between thighs and looks similar to jocks/briefs worn worldwide. In a second option the pouch covers and lifts only the penis up, or to one side while a slit-aperture (horizontal fly) <b>103</b> collars the scrotum. The scrotum may extend outside the brief which may be suitable for wear with most outerwear and in high humidity. In a third option horizontal fly <b>103</b> of the male underwear brief may let the penis out and collar the penis and the scrotum. The horizontal fly <b>103</b> further covers the pubic hair. The organs (penis and scrotum) may be pulled out and the buttocks region will stay covered without doffing the brief <b>100</b>. The horizontal fly <b>103</b> creates a comfortable collar close to the user's torso, and the second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> acts like a full-width fabric eyebrow, to shroud 1&#x2033;-2&#x2033; of the exposed organ.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be apparent to a skilled artisan that the embodiments described above are exemplary only, and that there may be many alterations made in these examples without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is in the field of garments and is more particularly related to an undergarment for men.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various forms of undergarments have been developed over the ages for men. The currently available briefs for men are generally constructed with one or more trunk panels and overlapping front panels. The overlapping front panels typically define a singular fly opening for access through the outermost panel to the penis for the purpose of urination. Several attempts have been made to solve the numerous problems associated with the known brief constructions, such as discomfort, lack of support and embarrassment due to unsightly bulging or slippage of the male genital organs. Hence there is clearly a need for a male underwear brief with various options for supporting and exposing the male genital organ in different ways and to provide a comfortable wearing for 24 hours continuously in a day.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment of the invention a male underwear garment is provided having a waistband, fabric material joined circumferentially to the waistband, contiguously forming a back panel and a front panel, a first and a second leg opening for a person's two legs, and a horizontally oriented and aligned fly comprising a horizontal linear opening in the front panel of a width positioned at a height on the front panel to be, when worn, substantially even with a user's genitalia, the fly comprising an added flap panel of at least the width of the horizontal linear opening, sewn over the horizontal linear opening on three edges of the added flap panel, top and both sides, left open at a bottom edge below the horizontal linear opening, such that access is upward into the garment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment the garment is fabricated from stretch material, providing a snug-fit boxer garment. Also in one embodiment the snug-fit garment further comprises a first elastic band joined continuously along a lower edge of the horizontal linear opening. Also in one embodiment the snug-fit garment further comprises a second elastic band joined continuously along an upper edge of the horizontal linear opening. In yet another embodiment the snug-fit garment further comprises a forward-facing pouch extending from the front panel, the pouch substantially the width of the fly opening, and formed above the fly opening.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an alternative embodiment the garment is a men's brief fabricated from passive fabric, the brief having leg openings with reinforced edges, and wherein the horizontal linear opening and the added flap panel extend from the reinforced edge of one leg opening to the reinforced edge of the other leg opening. In one embodiment the brief garment further comprises a first elastic band joined continuously along a lower edge of the horizontal linear opening and stitched to the reinforced edges of both leg openings. Also in one embodiment the brief garment further comprises a second elastic band joined continuously along an upper edge of the horizontal linear opening and stitched to the reinforced edges of both leg openings. And in another embodiment the brief garment further comprises a forward-facing pouch extending from the front panel, the pouch substantially the width of the fly opening, and formed above the fly opening. In one embodiment the brief garment further comprises a third horizontal elastic band joined only to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings over the upper front panel above and parallel to the first and second horizontal elastic bands.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In still another embodiment the brief garment the upper front panel comprises material such that the upper front panel joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings from the second elastic band upwards to a first point on the reinforced edges of the leg openings a specific distance along the reinforced edges of the leg openings from the lower edge of the second elastic band, and joined from above to the reinforced edges of the leg openings down to a second point on the reinforced edges of the leg openings lower on the leg openings from the first point creates an extension loop of two layers of material extending to the front a distance equal to the specific distance and ending in a folded edge, which extension, folded down along a line from the first point on the reinforced edges of the leg openings, positions the folded edge of the extension along the lower edge of the first and second elastic bands, and the extension, then joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, forms the pouch from inside the underwear brief. In another embodiment the pouch is formed by controlling the cut of the upper front panel to provide sufficient width such that the upper front panel, joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings, provides the forward extending pouch.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of the undergarment the pouch is formed by stitching three or more pieces of fabric into a pouch shape having a planar outer periphery, cutting out a region in the front panel of the underwear garment of the size of the outer periphery of the pouch, and stitching the pouch to the front panel around the planar outer periphery. And in yet another embodiment the pouch and the horizontal fly are formed as a separate assembly having a planar outer periphery, cutting out a region in the front panel of the underwear garment of the size of the outer periphery of the separate assembly, and stitching the separate assembly to the front panel around the planar outer periphery.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is a side perspective view of a male underwear brief <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Male underwear brief <b>100</b> comprises an elastic waistband <b>101</b> attached to the upper periphery of the brief <b>100</b>, cloth material joined circumferentially to waistband <b>101</b> which forms a back panel <b>106</b>, an upper front panel <b>104</b>, and a crotch panel <b>105</b> proceeding from a lower region of the back panel <b>106</b> to the front and upward, a first and a second opening <b>102</b> for a person's legs and a horizontally oriented and aligned fly opening <b>103</b>. The edges of the first and the second openings <b>102</b> for the person's legs are reinforced in most embodiments, and in most cases the reinforced edges are of elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The horizontal fly opening <b>103</b> in the garment features a symmetrical slit-aperture that is cushioned, flexible and held close to the user's torso, where it can be positioned below, between or above a user's genitalia. When the genitalia is inside the garment above the fly, the slit-aperture closes under their overhanging weight. Since the fly opening has no fasteners, a user can easily pull the scrotum, or the penis and scrotum, out through the fly, which forms a soft collar around the base of the organs. In most embodiments the cloth material is stretchy and cut to accommodate changes in size and positioning of men's genitals. In one embodiment horizontally oriented and aligned fly opening <b>103</b> is positioned low in the front of brief <b>100</b>. Back panel <b>106</b> and crotch panel <b>105</b> are joined to reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>. The upper front panel is joined to the reinforced edges of leg openings <b>102</b> as well, and ends at a horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> attached continuously to upper front panel <b>104</b>. Horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> is attached to each of the reinforced edges of leg openings <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment the upper extent of the material of crotch panel <b>105</b> is at line <b>110</b>. This creates an overlapped fly opening <b>103</b> open from below upward into the brief, of a vertical dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;. This dimension may vary depending on the placement of both the upper end of the crotch panel, and the lower end of the upper front panel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>is cross-section through horizontal fly <b>103</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>taken along section line <b>1</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b><i>b </i>into the brief. In this particular embodiment there is elastic band <b>108</b> overlying the upward-extending crotch panel material <b>105</b>, but there is no band on the upper edge of crotch panel <b>105</b>, which ends at line <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>). In some cases this edge may be hemmed. Again, the placement and attachment of the crotch panel material and the upper panel material determine dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;, which may vary accordingly. The embodiment represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>may be considered a &#x201c;one-band&#x201d; embodiment. In yet another embodiment upper front panel <b>104</b> may end without an elastic band, at an edge that may be, for example, hemmed as well, and this particular embodiment may be considered a &#x201c;no band&#x201d; embodiment, but nevertheless creates an upwardly opening overlapped horizontal fly opening of dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>illustrates the cross-section of the fly panel in another embodiment, wherein another elastic band <b>107</b> is added at the upper edge of the crotch panel. The elastic bands may be of equal height and weight, or different, and the overlap may be variously managed as described above. The embodiment represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>may be considered a &#x201c;two-band&#x201d; embodiment. At least one other two-band embodiment is described additionally below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side perspective view of male underwear brief <b>100</b> illustrating another embodiment of a &#x201c;two-band&#x201d; brief, wherein a front pouch is also provided, not shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c</i>. To better illustrate how a pouch is formed with the upper front panel, the upper front panel in shown in an open position and in subsequent stages of assembly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Crotch panel <b>105</b> proceeds upward from a lower region of back panel <b>106</b> to the front and ends at a first horizontal elastic band <b>107</b> joined securely to each of first and second leg openings <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>. At this stage of assembly edges of upper front panel <b>104</b> are stitched to the elastic leg bands <b>102</b> down to point (a) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Note that point (a) is repeated on the opposite leg opening, although not seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The bottom edge of upper front panel <b>104</b> ends at and is joined to a second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side perspective view of male underwear brief <b>100</b>, illustrating the upper front panel in a partly fixed condition, according to an embodiment of the present invention. One side of upper front panel <b>104</b> is joined to the leg openings on both sides at two different points (a), (b) to form an extended loop as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The opposite edges of horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> are stitched respectively to the reinforced edges of leg openings <b>102</b> at the opposite sides, and are positioned in one embodiment below the position of band <b>107</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>. This is optional placement in different embodiments, and the position of band <b>108</b> may vary, affecting the dimension &#x201c;d&#x201d;, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c</i>. Finally, the edges of the upper front panel pouch are stitched to the reinforced edges of the leg openings as shown, down to the horizontal fly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">First horizontal elastic band <b>107</b> and second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> are only stitched to the edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>, leaving an opening up from the bottom of the horizontal fly to the inside of the brief.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross sectional view of the male underwear brief, essentially the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, illustrating the arrangement of the two horizontal elastic bands in this example. The bands are only stitched to the elastic leg bands <b>102</b>. This leaves an opening up from the bottom of the fly to the inside of the upper front panel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side perspective view of male underwear brief <b>100</b>, illustrating the placement of a third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b>, according to an embodiment. The upper front panel is folded, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with point (a) and point (b) relatively close together in this example, on both leg openings as shown. Third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> is joined only to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b> and extends across the outside of the upper front panel <b>104</b> just above and parallel to second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b>. The position of band <b>109</b> is below the attachment points (b) intentionally to provide support in use, as the pouch is intended to support a user's organ or organs.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> is stitched above second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> and below attachment points (b) to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>, but not to the upper front panel <b>104</b> or anywhere else. Since the third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> is stitched only to the reinforced edges of the leg openings <b>102</b>, it can be pulled outward. In alternative embodiments points (b) may be positioned on the edges of the leg openings further below points (a), providing a lower opening from inside into the pouch that is formed by the folded material, and the third horizontal elastic band <b>109</b> may be stitched continuously across the upper front panel, inside or outside.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross sectional view of the male underwear brief illustrating the arrangement of the three horizontal elastic bands in this example. Crotch panel <b>105</b> proceeds upwardly from a lower region of the back panel to the front and ends at first horizontal elastic band <b>107</b> attached continuously to the crotch panel and to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings. Upper front panel <b>104</b> is joined to the reinforced edges of the leg openings and ends at horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> attached continuously to the upper front panel. Band <b>108</b> is attached to each of the reinforced edges of leg openings typically at some distance below band <b>107</b>. This leaves an opening up from the bottom of the horizontal fly to the inside of the upper front panel <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In alternative embodiments the position of band <b>108</b> may be varied from directly over band <b>107</b> to substantially below band <b>107</b>, varying the vertical dimension of the upwardly-extending opening into the brief. Band <b>109</b> is stitched above and parallel to band <b>108</b> to each of the reinforced edges of the leg openings at a distance that may vary, but is typically placed to support the pouch developed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side perspective view of male underwear brief <b>100</b> with the fold of the upper front panel in a final position. The extended loop of upper front panel <b>104</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, has been folded downward. The folded loop is brought down, and the top edge of the loop comes right to the bottom edge of horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> at line <b>111</b>. The side edges of the loop are stitched along the reinforced edges of the leg openings down to the horizontal fly thereby forming a pouch entry from within the brief along a horizontal line from points (a) and (b) on each leg opening. The relative positions of bands <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b> are shown now in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as dotted lines, because they are behind the folded down pouch material. It should be noted that the extent of material <b>104</b> may be adjusted, depending on a chosen distance between points (a) and (b), which define an opening size into an internal pouch, to provide the proper placement of edge <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In still another embodiment of the invention a front pouch may be formed by fabric cut, rather than by folding the fabric of the upper front panel as described in detail above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>is a perspective view of the brief showing horizontal elastic bands <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>109</b>. In this embodiment upper panel <b>104</b> is cut to provide a width w1 across points (a) to establish a dimension across the front of the brief, and another width w2 across points (b) below point (a) for the same purpose. W1 and w2 will typically be not the same, but w1 greater than w2.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b </i>illustrates an exemplary cut for upper front panel material <b>104</b> with points (a) and (b) and widths w1 and w2. The edges are curved outwardly as shown between points (a) and (b). It is essential that the distance along the curve of the cut fabric from points (a) and (b) on each side be the same distance as between (a) and (b) on each leg band of the brief. This way, when the fabric is sewn to the leg bands on each side an outwardly-extending pouch may be formed. This pouch in use supporting a user's organ or organs will tend to form outwardly and downward as well.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Horizontal fly <b>103</b> can be stretched more than 25% to let the penis and scrotum out, or to just let the scrotum out, and to provide a slack-line-type closure for a supportive upper pouch (i.e. for upper front panel <b>104</b>) to hold the penis, or the penis and scrotum. When one or both organs are pulled out through vertically-symmetrical, horizontal fly <b>103</b>, the fly creates a comfortable collar close to the user's torso, and the second horizontal elastic band <b>108</b> shrouds 1&#x2032;-2&#x2032; of the exposed organ(s), like a full-width fabric eyebrow. The first, second and third elastic bands may have a width of from &#xbc;&#x2033;-&#x215d;&#x2033; and are wrapped up for comfort in the fabric of brief <b>100</b> or other suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the male underwear brief in this example provides various options for the person to provide a continuous comfortable wearing for 24 hours every day. In one option the pouch formed of the extra material of the upper front panel covers and lifts both the penis and the scrotum, while slit-aperture horizontal fly <b>103</b> closes under the overhanging weight of the penis with the scrotum under. The pouch formed with the extended loop of the extra material of the upper front panel absorbs urine, reduces rolling and squeezing of organs between thighs and looks similar to jocks/briefs worn worldwide. In a second option the pouch covers and lifts only the penis up, or to one side, while a slit-aperture (horizontal fly) <b>103</b> collars the scrotum. The scrotum may extend outside the brief which may be suitable for wear with most outerwear and in high humidity. In a third option horizontal fly <b>103</b> of the male underwear brief may let the penis out and collar the penis and the scrotum. The horizontal fly <b>103</b> further covers the pubic hair. The organs (penis and scrotum) may be pulled out and the buttocks region will stay covered without doffing the brief <b>100</b>. With the penis and scrotum exposed through fly <b>103</b>, a user need not remove brief <b>100</b> in order to sit on a toilet and urinate quickly and comfortably with no risk of urine accidently wetting the brief or the man's leg.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention the horizontal fly and supporting pouch described in enabling detail above for a male underwear brief is applied to snug-fitting boxer male underwear shorts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective front view of a pair of snug-fitting boxer male underwear shorts <b>901</b>, comprising a stretch waistband <b>902</b> leg bands <b>903</b> and a small crotch panel <b>904</b>. Boxer shorts of this sort are typically manufactured with two-way stretch material, but always at least one-way stretch material. The fact of the stretch material when the shorts are worn, ensures a relatively tight fit depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> by stretch arrows <b>905</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is simply exemplary, and there may be many variations in the known art. For example, the legs may be considerably longer than the legs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The waist may be considerably higher, or somewhat lower. These differences have little or no influence on the fit of the garment across the genital area in front of the person wearing the boxer shorts.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Lastly an area <b>905</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which denotes the fabric portion of the snug-fitting boxer shorts that overlies the genital area of the person wearing the boxer shorts. Region <b>905</b> is shown in dotted outline. Any fly opening in this area in snug-fitting boxer shorts is atypical and unusual. This is ostensibly because the stretch fabric providing the snug fit is thought to provide needed support for male genitalia. Further, a typical vertically-oriented fly opening would likely gap open due to the forces from the stretch fabric, and would defeat the snug-fit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a pair of snug-fitting boxer shorts <b>1001</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, having a waistband <b>1002</b>, leg bands <b>1003</b>, a crotch panel <b>1004</b>, and a horizontally oriented fly arrangement <b>1005</b>. In this embodiment a fabric panel <b>1006</b>, preferably of the same or a similar stretch material used for the majority of the brief, is stitched to the fabric of the brief in a position as shown, the stitching accomplished on three sides of the added panel, top and both sides, leaving the bottom edge <b>1007</b> open. An edgewise slit is made in the main fabric below the added panel at a vertical position of about one-half of the height of the added panel. The result of the added panel, stitched on three sides to the main fabric, and the slit from side-to-side as shown, is a hidden fly opening of the sort described above for briefs. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c</i>. The lower unstitched edge of the added panel may be hemmed, and one or both sides of the slit opening may be hemmed as well. This provides a very easy to use horizontal fly opening in a men's snug-fitting boxer undergarment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The slit opening is provided at a position on the front of the boxer undergarment that is close to the height position of the penis, so access to the slit is convenient. The slit may be from perhaps two to six inches in horizontal extent in different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross section of the fly opening provided, taken along section line <b>11</b>-<b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Added panel <b>1006</b> is shown stitched at the top to the main fabric, which has been slit, providing a flapped opening up into the boxer undergarment, which a wearer may easily use to expose the penis for urination, for example. In some cases the edges of the slit opening may be hemmed, or treated in another manner to prevent unraveling of fabric, for example, but these sorts of treatments are not essential to the invention. Since this view is a section view, the side stitching of the added panel does not show. Further, the added panel being the same stretch material, or similar material, as the boxer shorts, the snug-fit characteristic should not be impaired in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a pair of snug-fitting boxer shorts in another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> appears the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> from the outside, but includes at least one, and in some cases two, elastic bands that may be stitched to the original fabric along the edges of the horizontal slit made in the original fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a cross-section of the slit and fly arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> taken along line <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this embodiment an elastic band <b>1208</b>, in length at least the length of the horizontal slit, is stitched or otherwise adhered to the original fabric along an upper edge of the slit opening. This elastic band strengthens the material along the slit and adds some extra fabric tension. In some embodiments a second elastic band <b>1207</b> is added along the lower edge of the slit opening. The added fabric panel <b>1206</b> is stitched to the original fabric above the added elastic band <b>1208</b>, but may be stitched to the elastic band. Again, the side stitching does not show in this section view, but it may be understood that the added panel is stitched along the top and both sides, but left open at the lower edge.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a pair of snug-fit boxer shorts in yet another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment a front pouch <b>1410</b> is formed above the horizontal fly implemented in the boxer shorts. This pouch requires that a region of the original fabric be cut out within the region that the pouch is to be formed. The cutout may be essentially the size of the horizontal and vertical extent of the pouch, or somewhat smaller. A pouch is formed in this example from two or more pieces of fabric sewn together, which is then stitched to the original fabric on all four sides around the cut-out region. The nature of this pouch is better seen in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a cross-section taken along section line <b>15</b>-<b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The horizontal slit providing opening to the outside is the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, including the added panel/flap that provides that the slit is hidden. Pouch <b>1410</b> is shown as stitched to the original fabric around the opening made in the original fabric above the added horizontal slit. The pouch is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> as having an upper and a lower panel stitched together at an outside extremity, but in other embodiments the upper and lower pieces seen may be one piece folded. The side panels seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are not seen in this cross-section view. In one embodiment there may be no side panels, and the upper and lower portions of the pouch may be gathered on the left and right edges and stitched together.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When not in use the added pouch may lie loosely on the front of the garment. The pouch provides a support for user's genitalia, either just the penis, or both the penis and the scrotum, which a user may place in or remove from the pouch easily. In one use the penis might be supported in the pouch, and the scrotum may extend to the outside through the horizontal fly, providing, for example, a cooling effect.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The skilled artisan will understand that the pouch may be constructed in a variety of ways to be added to the snug-fit boxer garment. In one embodiment a fabric assembly providing both a pouch and a horizontal slit fly opening may be separately manufactured and provided to customers to be easily added either by an end user or by a seamstress or tailor to an existing snug-fit boxer garment. In this embodiment the pre-manufactured assembly will have an outer periphery, typically substantially quadrilateral. The end user or tailor/seamstress need only mark the outline of the separate assembly on the front of the existing garment, cut out the marked section of the garment, and stitch the separate assembly to the garment around the periphery of the cut-out in the garment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an exemplary extent <b>1411</b> for cut-out and addition as a dotted outline.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It will be apparent to a skilled artisan that the embodiments described above are exemplary only, and that there may be many alterations made in these examples without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
